      "Text 2 chunk: RNA and DNA are targeted for lysosomal degradation via several pathways, including LC3-dependent autophagic degradation of stress granules (condensates of protein and RNA)120, p62- and NDP52-dependent autophagic degradation of retrotransposon RNA121, lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2C-dependent direct binding to RNA (also DNA122) for lysosomal degradation123 and a lysosomal puta- tive RNA/DNA transporter, SID1 transmembrane family, member 2 (SIDT2), that mediates direct uptake of RNA (and DNA124) for lyso- somal degradation125. At present, little is known about whether or how RNAutophagy (also known as RNAphagy) and DNAutophagy (also known as DNAphagy) affect health and aging. However, it is reasonable to suggest that nucleic acid turnover is essential for health, as accumulation of damaged or unnecessary DNA and RNA in the cytosol promotes inflammation, cancer and even acceler- ated aging68,126,127. DNA damage triggers autophagy and subtypes of autophagy that are considered to be cell survival responses128; in contrast, genetic or age-dependent impairment of DNA repair leads to genomic instability, cellular dysfunction, cell death and acceler- ated aging68. Exogenous DNA or RNA (for example, microbial) or endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm may trigger autophagy. Nuclear DNA (including extranuclear chroma- tin) could be aberrantly released into the cytoplasm as a result of impaired nuclear envelope integrity, nuclear envelope blebbing or nuclear export processes129, while mitochondrial DNA could leak into the cytoplasm as a result of mitochondrial damage and inef- ficient elimination of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy126,127. The cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING), or RIG-I–MAVS, signaling axis detects these nucleic acid fragments to initiate an innate immune reaction, linking it to auto- immunity, inflammation, senescence and autophagy129.\n",

      "Text 2 chunk: Glycophagy, therefore, is essential for cellular function and survival, suggesting that levels of glycophagy could determine organismal health and possibly longevity. Lipophagy. Intracellular storage and use of lipids is critical to main- tain cellular energy homeostasis. In response to starvation, triglyc- erides stored in lipid droplets are hydrolyzed by specific lipases into free fatty acids for energy metabolism. Lipid droplets can also undergo selective degradation by autophagy, termed lipophagy, as an alternative mechanism for regulating lipid homeostasis (Fig. 1a, pathway (4))100. Thus far, a specific receptor coupling lipid droplets to autophagosomes and trafficking to lysosomes has not yet been identified, although LC3-mediated engulfment of lipid droplets has been observed101. Moreover, CMA has been implicated in degrada- tion of the lipid droplet-associated proteins perilipin 2 (PLIN2) and perilipin 3 (PLIN3)102. Lysosomal acid lipases are involved in the degradation of lipid droplets; in particular, lipolysis is conducted primarily by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL), and selective knockdown of ATGL and HSL in mice results in selective inhibition of lipid droplet degradation, while other autophagy processes (that is, degradation of proteins and organelles) serve as a compensatory mechanism to replenish the reduced availability of energy substrates103. An age-dependent decline in basal autophagy in the liver may underlie the accumu- lation of hepatic lipids, which in turn has been proposed to con- tribute to metabolic conditions as well as impairing autophagy, a vicious cycle promoting aging100. For example, age-dependent reduction in CMA is likely due to alterations in the lipid composi- tion of discrete microdomains at the lysosomal membrane, includ- ing altered dynamics and stability of the CMA receptor LAMP2A in the lysosome104.\n",

      "Text 2 chunk: Xenophagy (from the Greek meaning ‘to eat foreign matter’) is the process by which autophagy targets pathogens154. Many pathogens are known to be degraded by autophagy, while others take over core autophagy components for their own ben- efit155 (Fig. 1a, pathway (9)). Indeed, several studies have dem- onstrated that autophagy can target bacteria such as Rickettsia conorii156, Listeria monocytogenes157, Streptococcus pyogenes158 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis159,160. Xenophagy may also protect the body against invasion by viruses and parasites. Upon their intake by inhalation, M. tuberculosis bacteria are cap- tured by alveolar macrophages. However, they have evolved the abil- ity to impair phagosome maturation (which under normal conditions would lead to phagocytosis) and end up hijacking macrophages161. Later on, using secretions from ESX-1 (6-kDa early secretory anti- genic target (ESAT-6) secretion system 1), the bacteria are able to break free from the phagosome and enter the cytosol. Here xenoph- agy comes into action. cGAS detects the bacterial DNA162, which results in ubiquitination of the invading bacteria by Smurf1 (or par- kin)163. NBR1 (or p62) attaches to these ubiquitin chains, resulting in the recruitment of LC3B and, ultimately, autophagic degradation164. Indeed, an absence of autophagic machinery components, in par- ticular, ULK1 (ref. 165), BECN1 (ref. 166), p62 (ref. 167), ATG7 (ref. 168) and TBK1 (ref. 167), may promote proliferation of the bacteria. The mechanism is similar for specific viruses. BECN1 and p62 in selec- tive autophagy of viral capsids can be protective against Sindbis virus169,170. However, other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 1, have evolved to inhibit autophagy by targeting BECN1 (ref. 171).\n",

      "Text 2 chunk: Glycophagy, therefore, is essential for cellular function and survival, suggesting that levels of glycophagy could determine organismal health and possibly longevity. Lipophagy. Intracellular storage and use of lipids is critical to main- tain cellular energy homeostasis. In response to starvation, triglyc- erides stored in lipid droplets are hydrolyzed by specific lipases into free fatty acids for energy metabolism. Lipid droplets can also undergo selective degradation by autophagy, termed lipophagy, as an alternative mechanism for regulating lipid homeostasis (Fig. 1a, pathway (4))100. Thus far, a specific receptor coupling lipid droplets to autophagosomes and trafficking to lysosomes has not yet been identified, although LC3-mediated engulfment of lipid droplets has been observed101. Moreover, CMA has been implicated in degrada- tion of the lipid droplet-associated proteins perilipin 2 (PLIN2) and perilipin 3 (PLIN3)102. Lysosomal acid lipases are involved in the degradation of lipid droplets; in particular, lipolysis is conducted primarily by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL), and selective knockdown of ATGL and HSL in mice results in selective inhibition of lipid droplet degradation, while other autophagy processes (that is, degradation of proteins and organelles) serve as a compensatory mechanism to replenish the reduced availability of energy substrates103. An age-dependent decline in basal autophagy in the liver may underlie the accumu- lation of hepatic lipids, which in turn has been proposed to con- tribute to metabolic conditions as well as impairing autophagy, a vicious cycle promoting aging100. For example, age-dependent reduction in CMA is likely due to alterations in the lipid composi- tion of discrete microdomains at the lysosomal membrane, includ- ing altered dynamics and stability of the CMA receptor LAMP2A in the lysosome104.\n",

      "Text 2 chunk: In particular, the balance between mTOR and AMPK activa- tion has a central role in immune cell maintenance and function. Upon mTOR activation, autophagic flux is reduced, accompanied by increased cellular glycolytic activity, giving rise to a proliferative and pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages. In contrast, AMPK activation drives autophagy and promotes the OXPHOS-dependent function of non- or anti-inflammatory macrophages188. Autophagy also regulates the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain- containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is an intra- cellular protein complex that activates caspase-1, which in turn catalyzes the cleavage, activation and subsequent release of pro- inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin (IL)-1β), which can induce neurodegeneration186,189. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been identified as a critical component of the innate immune response (that is, the response to microbial motifs, endogenous danger signals and environmental irritants) and orchestrates host immune homeostasis189. Defective autophagy, for example, in mod- els of selective knockout or knockdown of genes encoding compo- nents of the autophagic core machinery (for example, ATG5, ATG7, BECN1 and MAP1LC3B), results in unrestricted inflammasome activation and consequent inflammation. Likewise, promotion of autophagy through starvation or with pharmacological agents (for example, rapamycin) inhibits the inflammasome190. In addition, evidence stemming from an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD dem- onstrated mitophagy-induced inhibition of the NLRP3 inflamma- some, resulting in reduced neuroinflammation138. These findings imply an important role for autophagy in the regulation of inflam- mation and, in turn, aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Anti-aging effects of autophagy modulators The mounting evidence that an imbalance of autophagy is an impor- tant age-associated characteristic has driven extensive research into the development of compounds that can promote autophagy1.\n",
