Lim 1, Isabel Saez2, Alexander Springhorn2, Thorsten Hoppe 2, David Vilchez 2 & Malene Hansen1* Autophagy can degrade cargos with the help of selective autophagy receptors such as p62/ SQSTM1, which facilitates the degradation of ubiquitinated cargo. While the process of autophagy has been linked to aging, the impact of selective autophagy in lifespan regulation remains unclear. We have recently shown in Caenorhabditis elegans that transcript levels of sqst-1/p62 increase upon a hormetic heat shock, suggesting a role of SQST-1/p62 in stress response and aging. Here, we \ufb01nd that sqst-1/p62 is required for hormetic bene\ufb01ts of heat shock, including longevity, improved neuronal proteostasis, and autophagy induction. Fur- thermore, overexpression of SQST-1/p62 is suf\ufb01cient to induce autophagy in distinct tissues, extend lifespan, and improve the \ufb01tness of mutants with defects in proteostasis in an autophagy-dependent manner. Collectively, these \ufb01ndings illustrate that increased expression of a selective autophagy receptor is suf\ufb01cient to induce autophagy, enhance proteostasis and extend longevity, and demonstrate an important role for sqst-1/p62 in proteotoxic stress responses. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 OPEN 1 Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, Development, Aging and Regeneration Program, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. 2 Institute for Genetics and Cologne Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, Joseph Stelzmann Strasse 26, 50931 Cologne, Germany.", "email: ckumsta@sbpdiscovery.org; mhansen@sbpdiscovery.org NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2019) 10:5648 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1 1234567890():,; M acroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) facilitates degradation and recycling of cytosolic components, referred to as cargo, in response to nutrient deprivation or other stressors. Autophagy is initiated by the nucleation of a double membrane, which forms the phagophore. As the phago- phore expands, it begins to sequester cytosolic cargo into the growing vesicle. Upon completion, the autophagosome or amphisome (formed by fusion with vesicles from the endolyso- somal compartments) then fuse with acidic lysosomes, resulting in the degradation of the sequestered content by hydrolases. Autophagy is essential for survival, development, and organismal homeostasis1. It occurs at low levels under basal conditions, whereas developmental stimuli or cellular stress, including star- vation and heat shock (HS), can induce autophagy1,2. Further- more, autophagy can protect against pathologies, including neurodegeneration and aging3. The regulation of autophagy with age is incompletely understood, but several lines of evidence suggest that autophagy declines with age3. Conversely, autophagy genes are essential for lifespan extension in distinct longevity paradigms in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and Drosophila (for review see ref. 3). While these observations demonstrate a link between autophagy and aging, it remains unclear how the autophagy process affects longevity and healthspan. Autophagy was originally described as a \u2018bulk\u2019 turnover pro- cess, in which cytosolic components are indiscriminately recycled to provide amino acids and other building blocks during nutrient deprivation and cellular stress4. Emerging evidence indicates that selective types of autophagy degrade speci\ufb01c and possibly damaged cytosolic components in a tightly regulated manner.", "During selective autophagy, autophagosomes recruit speci\ufb01c types of cargo, including mitochondria and protein aggregates, through the action of autophagy receptors that connect the autophagosome to the cargo4. The binding of the autophagy receptors is facilitated by Atg8/LC3/GABARAP family proteins, which are proteolytically cleaved and conjugated with phospha- tidylethanolamine and incorporated into the forming autopha- gosomal membranes4. The selective autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, termed aggrephagy, can be facilitated by autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1 (hereafter referred to as p62). p62 has several conserved domains that are important for its function in autophagy. The C-terminal ubiquitin-asso- ciated (UBA) domain enables p62 to bind to ubiquitinated pro- teins4. The LC3-interacting region (LIR domain) allows binding of p62 to Atg8/LC3/GABARAP family members, and thus facil- itates degradation of ubiquitinated protein cargo5,6. p62-mediated aggrephagy also requires the Phox-and-Bem1 (PB1) domain of p62, which allows its self-oligomerization and strengthens bind- ing to the Atg8/LC3-containing autophagic membranes7. The degradation of ubiquitinated proteins can occur via autophagy as well as the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and p62 has been implicated in both processes; i.e., as a selective autophagy receptor, and through the delivery of ubiquitinated proteins for degradation to the proteasome8\u201312. p62 is constantly being degraded by autophagy5, and inhibition of autophagy leads to the accumulation of p62 aggregates in mice7, Drosophila13, and C. elegans14. These ubiquitin-positive aggregates are signi\ufb01cantly reduced in autophagy-de\ufb01cient mice and \ufb02ies when p62 is deleted13,15, indicating a role for p62 in aggregate formation. Furthermore, p62 has been found associated with ubiquitin- positive aggregates observed in neurodegenerative-disease mod- els, such as Huntington\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease13.", "The biolo- gical relevance of aggregate formation is still under debate and may depend on the cellular context and the size of the aggregates. To this end, it has been suggested that larger aggregates are less toxic to the cell than smaller aggregates dispersed throughout the cell16\u201318. While p62 overexpression can enhance protein aggregation, overexpression of p62 has protective effects on cell survival5 and p62 has an important role in preventing neurode- generative diseases10,12, although the exact protective mechan- isms are still unclear. Consistent with a key role in age-related disease, mice de\ufb01cient in p62 have reduced lifespan, increased oxidative stress19, synaptic de\ufb01ciencies, and memory impairment20, albeit neither signi\ufb01cant neurodegeneration nor aggregation formation are observed in neurons of these mice15. Older p62\u2212/\u2212 mice, how- ever, accumulate insoluble ubiquitinated proteins in the brain21. Similar to mice, Drosophila expressing mutant Ref(2)P/p62, which lacks either the PB1 or the UBA domain, are short-lived, have impaired movement, and mitochondrial defects22. In contrast, in C. elegans, mutations in the p62 ortholog sqst-1 cause no lifespan defects23,24, indicating a limited requirement for sqst-1/p62 (hereafter called sqst-1) under basal conditions in the nematode. The expression levels of p62 have been shown to decline with age in mice19, and reduced expression of p62 correlates with age- related neurodegenerative diseases in humans25,26. Notably, we recently reported that sqst-1 mRNA levels are markedly increased upon heat stress in C. elegans2, prompting the hypothesis that SQST-1 may play a role in the heat-shock response, in which heat-shock proteins and molecular chaperones are rapidly and transiently induced to ameliorate the deleterious effects of heat stress27.", "We further reported that exposure of C. elegans to a hormetic HS, i.e., a short stimulus with increased temperature that would be lethal at prolonged exposure, not only increases stress resistance and longevity, but also improves proteostasis in an autophagy-dependent manner2. Since emerging evidence suggests that the degradation of speci\ufb01c cargos by selective autophagy is important for maintaining health3, we investigated the role of SQST-1 in hormetic HS, lifespan, and proteostasis. Here we demonstrate that sqst-1 is required for autophagy induction as well as organismal bene\ufb01ts conferred by a hormetic HS. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of full-length SQST-1, but not truncated SQST-1 lacking the UBA domain, is suf\ufb01cient to increase longevity in C. elegans. SQST-1 over- expression leads to tissue-speci\ufb01c induction of autophagy and decreases aggregation of expanded PolyQ proteins as well as temperature-sensitive protein-folding mutants in an autophagy- dependent manner. These observations illustrate that over- expression of a selective autophagy receptor is suf\ufb01cient to induce autophagy and enhance longevity and proteostasis. As p62 plays an important role in many age-related diseases, our \ufb01ndings highlight potential therapeutic opportunities in inducing p62- mediated selective autophagy. Results sqst-1 regulates basal autophagy in a tissue-speci\ufb01c manner. A hormetic heat shock (HS) early in life of C. elegans induces autophagy and increases the transcription of autophagy-related genes, including sqst-12. HS causes proteotoxic stress, which is accompanied by protein unfolding and can ultimately lead to protein aggregation28,29. Protein aggregates and ubiquitinated protein conjugates accumulate upon a HS of 1 h at 36 \u00b0C in C. elegans (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b), as observed in human melanoma cells30.", "Since ubiquitinated proteins can be degraded by selective autophagy via the autophagy receptor p625, and a hormetic HS induces an increase of autophagosomes in C. elegans2, we asked if sqst-1 could play a role in the regulation of autophagy under heat-stress conditions. To this end, we \ufb01rst examined whether reduction of sqst-1 function would lead to autophagy defects under basal conditions. While SQST-1 protein expression appears limited to the pharynx and nerve-ring ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2019) 10:5648 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications neurons under basal conditions, sqst-1 is transcriptionally expressed in nearly all tissues in C. elegans14,31,32. Therefore, we monitored autophagy in nerve-ring neurons, intestine, body-wall muscle, and pharynx of sqst-1(ok2892) mutants, which expresses a truncated loss-of-function SQST-1 protein24,33, and in a CRISPR-engineered, full-length deletion of sqst-1 (sqst-1(syb764)) expressing GFP-tagged LGG-1/Atg834\u201336. This autophagy reporter visualizes autophagic structures (i.e., pre-autopha- gosomal structures, autophagosomes, and amphisomes) as \ufb02uorescent punctae. Both sqst-1 mutants showed a decrease in the number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae in nerve-ring neurons (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a, b), whereas the number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae was unchanged in the intestine, body-wall muscle, or pharynx (Fig. 1b\u2013d and Supplementary Fig. 2c\u2013h) [For hypodermal seam cells, see Supplementary Fig. 2i, j]. Concomitant analysis of a lipidation- de\ufb01cient GFP::LGG-1(G116A) mutant37 con\ufb01rmed that LGG-1/Atg8-positive structures were likely to represent autop- hagosomes in these four major tissues (Supplementary Fig. 2).", "Since the two sqst-1 mutants displayed the same autophagy phenotypes and were not compromised in the healthspan measures we investigated, i.e., movement, pharyngeal pumping, or progeny production (Supplementary Fig. 3), we used the sqst-1(ok2892) mutants in our subsequent analyses, unless stated otherwise. Monitoring the number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae does not conclusively inform on autophagic activity38. Therefore, we also performed autophagy-\ufb02ux assays in sqst-1(ok2892) mutants by injecting the autophagy inhibitor ba\ufb01lomycin A1 (BafA), which blocks autophagosomal turnover39,40. A change in the number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae upon BafA addition indicates that autophagy is active, whereas no change indicates that the cell/tissue is experiencing a block in autophagy. Notably, BafA treatment did not increase the number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae in the nerve-ring neurons of sqst-1(ok2892) mutants, which had very low numbers of autophagosomes under basal conditions (Fig. 1a), Taken together, these \ufb01ndings indicate that sqst-1 is required for autophagosome formation in neurons, as observed in HeLa cells7, rather than increasing the rate of autophagosomal turnover. In contrast, the intestine (Fig. 1b), body-wall muscles (Fig. 1c), as well as the pharynx (Fig. 1d) showed a clear increase in the number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae after BafA injection, consis- tent with autophagic turnover under basal conditions in non- neuronal tissues. In sum, these results indicate that sqst-1(ok2892) animals display a tissue-speci\ufb01c block in autophagy in nerve-ring neurons. sqst-1 is required for autophagy induction upon heat shock. To determine whether sqst-1 could play a role in the regulation of autophagy in response to heat stress, we next asked whether a hormetic HS would induce autophagy in different tissues of sqst-1 (ok2892) mutants.", "In contrast to WT animals2, exposure of sqst-1 (ok2892) mutants to a hormetic HS failed to induce autophago- some accumulation in nerve-ring neurons (Fig. 1e), intestine (Fig. 1f), body-wall muscle (Fig. 1g), and pharynx (Fig. 1h), indicating that sqst-1 is broadly required for autophagy induction in many tissues upon heat stress. Since we previously showed that a hormetic HS increases the mRNA levels of autophagy-related genes2, we performed quantitative RT-PCR analyses in sqst-1 (ok2892) mutants, and found that autophagy-related genes were increased in sqst-1(ok2892) mutants after HS similarly to WT animals (Supplementary Fig. 4a). sqst-1(ok2892) mutants simi- larly induced the heat-shock responsive gene hsp-70 compared with WT animals (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Since sqst-1(ok2892) mutants could induce heat-shock responsive- and autophagy genes following a hormetic HS, sqst-1 may function downstream of the transcriptional responses induced by HS. Altogether, our data suggest that HS-induced autophagy is sqst-1-dependent in the entire organism, whereas sqst-1 is required for basal autophagy speci\ufb01cally in neurons. sqst-1 is required for the bene\ufb01ts of a hormetic heat shock. In addition to inducing autophagy, a hormetic HS early in life of C. elegans increases longevity, improves stress resistance, and is suf\ufb01cient to prevent aggregation of intestinal and neuronal expanded PolyQ proteins2. Since we found sqst-1 to be required for autophagy induction after a hormetic HS, we asked whether sqst-1 could help mediate the bene\ufb01ts of a hormetic HS. Notably, sqst-1(ok2892) mutants did not bene\ufb01t from a hormetic HS on day 1 of adulthood as measured by thermo-resistance (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1), or longevity (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2), demonstrating that sqst-1 is required for the positive effect of hormetic HS on thermo-resistance and longevity.", "In contrast, sqst-1 was not required for the long lifespan of other conserved longevity paradigms that have been linked to autophagy3, including daf-2/insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants, germline-less glp-1 mutants, animals with reduced mTOR levels (let-363 RNAi), and animals with reduced levels of components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (cyc-1 RNAi) (Supplementary Data 1). This indicates that sqst-1, unlike core autophagy genes3, is not broadly implicated in lifespan extension in C. elegans, but instead is required under speci\ufb01c, potentially proteotoxic conditions, such as a hormetic HS. Finally, to determine whether selective autophagy mediated by sqst-1 could be involved in the removal of protein aggregates, we used C. elegans expressing tissue-speci\ufb01c YFP-tagged PolyQ proteins41\u201343. In C. elegans, PolyQ proteins accumulate with age41, and have been shown to be ubiquitinated44. In contrast to the increased PolyQ aggregation observed upon reduction of core autophagy genes2,45, PolyQ aggregation was unchanged under basal conditions in neurons of sqst-1(ok2892) mutants (Fig. 2c). This result suggests that sqst-1-dependent autophagy is not required for basal degradation of neuronal PolyQ aggregates. In contrast to WT animals in which a hormetic HS reduces aggregation2, sqst-1(ok2892) animals expressing neuronal PolyQ proteins showed an increased aggregate load in neurons following a hormetic HS (Fig. 2c). Moreover, \ufb02uorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that HS increased the mobility of the neuronal PolyQ aggregates in WT, but not in sqst-1(ok2892) mutant animals (Fig. 2d, e), while having only limited effects on diffuse neuronal PolyQ proteins (Supplemen- tary Fig. 5). Consistently, a hormetic HS increased the soluble portion and decreased the insoluble portion of PolyQ proteins in WT, but not in sqst-1(ok2892) mutant animals (Supplementary Fig. 6). Similar to aggregate load (Fig.", "2c), the baseline values for WT and sqst-1(ok2892) animals were not signi\ufb01cantly different in FRAP (Fig. 2d, e) or in differential detergent extraction experiments (Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, sqst-1(ok2892) mutants expressing neuronal PolyQ proteins were not signi\ufb01- cantly longer lived following a hormetic HS (Supplementary Table 2). Collectively, these assays show that sqst-1 is required for the bene\ufb01ts of a hormetic HS on neuronal proteostasis. In contrast, sqst-1 was only partially required for intestinal proteostasis in terms of PolyQ aggregation, while muscle- speci\ufb01c PolyQ aggregation was unaffected by a hormetic HS or sqst-1(ok2892) mutation (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplemen- tary Table 2, i.e., aggregate number, FRAP, and lifespan). Taken together, these data suggest that sqst-1 is required when NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2019) 10:5648 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3 autophagy is induced by a hormetic HS and plays a key role in improving proteostasis particularly in neurons of PolyQ- expressing animals. Overexpression of SQST-1 is suf\ufb01cient to extend lifespan. We previously showed that a hormetic HS leads to an increase in the transcription of sqst-12, and observed that sqst-1 mRNA levels remained upregulated for several days after a HS (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Given the requirement of sqst-1 for HS-induced autophagy (Fig. 1) and the organismal bene\ufb01ts of a hormetic HS (Fig. 2), we next tested whether increasing sqst-1 levels in C. elegans was suf\ufb01cient to induce organismal bene\ufb01ts, similar to a hormetic HS. To this end, we overexpressed sqst-1 fused to gfp under the control of its endogenous promoter and found SQST-1::GFP to be expressed mainly in punctate structures in head neurons and in the pharynx throughout adulthood (Supplementary Fig. 8a).

Animals overexpressing SQST-1 (GFP-tagged or untagged), either from extrachromosomal arrays or from integrated loci, displayed an average lifespan extension of ~30% (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Data 2). Integrated SQST-1::GFP-expressing animals had a ~30\u2013100-fold increase in SQST-1 levels, whereas animals over- expressing untagged SQST-1 from extrachromosomal arrays in the sqst-1(syb764) mutant background had a ~2\u20137-fold increase in SQST-1 levels (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d), highlighting that a range of SQST-1 overexpression resulted in lifespan extension.", "Importantly, in the sqst-1(syb764) mutant, overexpression of an untagged, truncated SQST-1 protein without the UBA domain (SQST-1\u0394UBA), which enables p62 to bind ubiquitinated pro- teins4, did not extend lifespan (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 2; Supplementary Fig. 8d).

Of note, our collection of SQST-1::GFP-overexpressing strains generally dis- played healthspan parameters similar to WT animals (Supple- mentary Fig. 9). Collectively, these data show that overexpression of a selective autophagy receptor, SQST-1, is suf\ufb01cient to extend C. elegans lifespan. Since we found that sqst-1 was required for the lifespan increase mediated by a hormetic HS (Fig. 2d), we tested whether subjecting SQST-1-overexpressing animals to a hormetic HS would be additive for lifespan. The lifespan of animals over- expressing SQST-1::GFP under the endogenous promoter or under the neuronal rgef-1 promoter was unchanged after a hormetic HS (Fig. 3d, e and Supplementary Table 3). These results, together with the requirement of sqst-1 for the bene\ufb01ts of the hormetic HS (Fig. 2), are consistent with hormetic HS and SQST-1 overexpression extending lifespan by common mechanisms. SQST-1 overexpression improves proteostasis. Since sqst-1 was required for hormetic HS to alleviate neuronal PolyQ aggregation (Fig. 2c), we next investigated whether SQST-1 overexpression could similarly alleviate neuronal PolyQ aggregation. While the number of neuronal PolyQ aggregates in SQST-1-overexpressing animals was unchanged (Fig. 3f), the mobility of both the aggregated as well as the diffuse PolyQ proteins was increased upon overexpression of SQST-1 (Fig. 3g). These data suggest that SQST-1 overexpression changes the properties of aggregation- prone PolyQ::YFP.", "Furthermore, SQST-1 overexpression was suf\ufb01cient to extend the lifespan of animals expressing neuronal PolyQ proteins (Fig. 3h), as well as animals carrying temperature- sensitive (ts) missense mutations in genes causing protein mis- folding and tissue-speci\ufb01c protein aggregation46,47, i.e., dynamin GTPase (dyn-1(ts); neurons), Ras (let-60(ts); intestine), and myosin (unc-54(ts); muscle) (Supplementary Table 4). Taken together, SQST-1 overexpression was able to improve proteostasis and longevity in C. elegans with protein-folding defects. p62 can mediate the degradation of aggregation-prone proteins8\u201312. Therefore, we next asked by which mechanisms SQST-1 overexpression mediated proteostasis in C. elegans. We found that both endogenous and neuronal overexpression of SQST-1::GFP reduced the levels of ubiquitinated proteins compared with WT animals (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Since the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins can occur via the ubiquitin- proteasome system (UPS) as well as autophagic degradation, we next tested whether SQST-1-overexpressing animals exhibited elevated proteasome activity using a \ufb02uorogenic peptide substrate speci\ufb01c for the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome48. We found that glp-1 mutants, previously reported to exhibit increased proteasomal activity48, had an increase of 100% in their proteasome activity, whereas animals overexpressing SQST-1 under the endogenous promoter (SQST-1-overexpressing line 1 and 2) had either a ~10% marginal or ~30% signi\ufb01cant increase, respectively; and animals overexpressing SQST-1 in the neurons alone had a modest ~15% increase (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Since the proteasomal activity of SQST-1-overexpressing animals was only modestly increased, we next examined whether an induction of autophagy could contribute to the increased organismal health and proteostasis upon SQST-1 overexpression.", "First, we investigated if autophagy was required for the lifespan extension observed in SQST-1-overexpressing animals. We fed SQST-1-overexpressing animals bacteria expressing dsRNA targeting distinct autophagy-related genes from adulthood on. We found that RNAi targeting autophagy genes involved in different steps of the autophagy process, such as lgg-1/ATG8 (Fig. 4a), which is part of the Atg8-conjugation system, or cup-5 (Fig. 4b), whose loss impairs degradation of autolyso- somal contents49, abrogated the lifespan extension of SQST-1-overexpressing animals. A similar requirement was found for vps-34 and bec-1/Atg6, which are involved in nucleation of autophagosomal membranes, atg-18, which is involved in phagophore formation, and epg-5, which is involved in lysosomal degradation50 (Supplementary Data 3). Since multiple genes with functions in different steps of the autophagy process were similarly required for the lifespan extension conferred by overexpression of SQST-1, autophagy as a general process is likely required for the lifespan extension of SQST-1-overexpressing animals.", "To explore whether autophagy was required for the effects of SQST-1-overexpression on proteostasis, we again used dyn-1(ts), 100 a b c d f g e 75 50 SQST-1::GFP/tdTOMATO::LGG-1 co-localization Segregated localization Co- localization 25 0 100 75 50 Percent alive Percent alive 25 0 0 10 P = 0.2 P = 0.5 P < 0.0001 P < 0.0001 20 Days Days 30 0 0.5 0.0 \u20130.5 200 150 100 50 Diameter (\u03bcm) Median 1.12 \u03bcm Median 0.74 \u03bcm WT SQST-1 OE SQST-1 OE SQST-1 OE WT WT SQST-1 OE WT DIC LGG-1 LGG-1 SQST-1 SQST-1 0 200 100 50 0 150 100 50 0 0.2 0.6 1.0 1.4 1.8 2.2 2.6 3.0 Diameter (\u03bcm) 0.2 DMSO DMSO BafA BafA 0.6 1.0 1.4 1.8 2.2 2.6 3.0 ICQ score Number of values Number of values Punctae in nervering 10 20 30 WT-CTRL WT-CTRL SQST-1 OE-CTRL SQST-1 OE-CTRL SQST-1 OE-lgg-1 RNAi SQST-1 OE-cup-5 RNAi WT-lgg-1 RNAi rgef-1p::gfp::lgg-1 lgg-1p::gfp::lgg-1 WT-cup-5 RNAi NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2019) 10:5648 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 7 let-60(ts), and unc-54(ts) protein-folding mutants, since these strains allowed for co-expression of GFP-tagged SQST-1. Over- expression of SQST-1::GFP improved the movement defects of dyn-1(ts) and let-60(ts), but not muscle-speci\ufb01c unc-54(ts) mutants at the restrictive temperature in an autophagy- dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 11a-c). Furthermore, SQST-1::GFP accumulated upon lgg-1/ATG8 RNAi in nerve-ring neurons and distal intestines of dyn-1(ts) and let-60(ts) mutants, but not in body-wall muscle of unc-54(ts) mutants, which under control conditions showed a striking increase in SQST-1::GFP accumulation (Supplementary Fig. 11d\u2013f). These data indicate that the effects of SQST-1 on proteostasis are tissue-speci\ufb01c and that SQST-1 overexpression may improve proteostasis in neurons and intestine at least in part by engaging autophagy.", "Moreover, we found that overexpression of SQST-1::GFP in atg-18(gk378) hypomorphs, which display a high percentage of larval lethality51, signi\ufb01cantly increased the survival of atg-18(gk378) larvae, while overexpressing LGG-1/Atg8 did not (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b). This indicates that SQST-1-overexpressing animals could at least partially overcome the autophagy defects caused by the hypomorphic mutation in atg-18/WIPI. Taken together, our data support the notion that SQST-1 overexpression in C. elegans improves neuronal and intestinal proteostasis upon proteotoxic conditions in an autophagy-dependent manner, possibly by facilitating the elimination of protein aggregates. Overexpression of SQST-1 induces neuronal autophagy. Since autophagy-related genes were required for the SQST-1- mediated bene\ufb01ts on lifespan and proteostasis (Fig. 3), we explored whether SQST-1 overexpression was suf\ufb01cient to regulate autophagy. First, we asked whether SQST-1 co- localized with LGG-1/Atg8 in adult C. elegans co-expressing sqst-1p::sqst-1::gfp and lgg-1p::tdtomato::lgg-1 from endogenous promoters. Most of the SQST-1::GFP structures observed in and around the nerve ring of day 1 adult animals co-localized with tdTOMATO::LGG-1 (Fig. 4c), consistent with SQST-1 interacting with LGG-1/Atg8 in adult C. elegans, as previously shown in embryos52. We next monitored autophagy in individual tissues of C. elegans expressing GFP-tagged LGG-1/Atg8 and overexpres- sing untagged SQST-1. Endogenous SQST-1 overexpression led to a marked increase in the number as well as size of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive structures around the nerve ring compared with WT (Fig. 4d, e, Supplementary Fig. 12c), whereas a lipidation-de\ufb01cient GFP::LGG-1(G116A) reporter showed few \u2018background\u2019 punctae, irrespective of SQST-1 levels (Supplemen- tary Fig. 12c). Notably, the median diameter of neuronal GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae was ~400 nm larger in SQST-1-overexpressing animals compared with WT animals (Fig.", "4e and Supplementary Table 5), suggesting that SQST-1 overexpression potentiates an enlargement of the autophagosome in neurons. Under basal conditions, the endogenously expressed GFP::LGG-1/Atg8 reporter does not allow for a clear separa- tion of neurons from other tissues in the head region53. In SQST-1-overexpressing animals, however, enlarged GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae were observed in the region of the nerve-ring neurons, which provides further evidence for the increased formation of enlarged autophagic structures in that tissue (Fig. 4f). We also observed an increase in the number and size of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive puncta in the intestine and the pharynx of these animals (Supplementary Fig. 12d\u2013g and Supplementary Table 5). To further assess the dynamic status of the autophagy process, we injected SQST-1-overexpressing animals with BafA in autophagy-\ufb02ux assays. The number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae in neurons and the intestine of both WT and SQST-1- overexpressing animals increased upon BafA injection (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 12h), consistent with an induction of autophagy in these tissues. In contrast, the pharynx of SQST-1- overexpressing animals showed no change in the number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae after BafA injection (Supple- mentary Fig. 12i), indicating a block in autophagy in this tissue. Thus, our results indicate that SQST-1 overexpression leads to autophagy induction in neurons and the intestine, which supports the idea that SQST-1-mediated longevity and improved proteo- stasis upon proteotoxic conditions occurs at least in part by the induction of tissue-speci\ufb01c autophagy. Discussion While autophagy as a process has been linked to aging and age-related diseases, the role of selective autophagy remains less clear.", "Here we demonstrate an important role for the selective autophagy receptor SQST-1 in aging and proteostasis, since we found sqst-1 to be required for the organismal bene\ufb01ts of a hormetic HS in C. elegans, and overexpression of SQST-1 was suf\ufb01cient to extend lifespan and improve proteostasis in an autophagy-dependent manner. Collectively, our studies indicate that SQST-1, and possibly selective autophagy, plays an important role in longevity and health upon proteotoxic conditions.

ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2019) 10:5648 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications We have previously shown that core autophagy genes, including lgg-1/ATG8 and bec-1/ATG6, are required for the life- span extension induced by hormetic HS2 as well as by multiple conserved longevity paradigms3. In contrast, we found that sqst-1 was not required for the longevity of long-lived daf-2 insulin/IGF- 1 receptor mutants, germline-less glp-1 mutants, and animals with reduced mTOR levels (let-363 RNAi) or mitochondrial respiration (cyc-1 RNAi), indicating a context-speci\ufb01c require- ment for sqst-1 in lifespan.", "Since sqst-1 is required for lifespan extension caused by reduced levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin frh-130, which leads to iron depletion and the induction of stress responses23,54, we propose that sqst-1 may be speci\ufb01cally required in mediating selective autophagy under conditions of proteotoxic stress. While sqst-1 was required systemically for autophagy induction in response to a hormetic HS, loss of sqst-1 did not abrogate PolyQ aggregation under basal conditions, which is in contrast to the loss of core autophagy genes that has been shown to increase PolyQ aggregates2,45. This may indicate that PolyQ aggregates in C. elegans are either turned over by bulk autophagy rather than sqst-1-mediated aggrephagy, or that bulk autophagy plays a role in preventing the formation of PolyQ aggregates possibly by the degradation of soluble PolyQ. Under basal conditions, sqst-1 was instead speci\ufb01cally required for autophagosome formation in neurons. This implies that autophagy in non-neuronal tissues is mediated in an sqst-1-independent manner, and suggests that sqst-1-mediated neuronal autophagy may not be important for lifespan determination under non-stress conditions in C. elegans. Since sqst-1 mutants had similar levels of PolyQ aggregation in neurons compared with WT animals, it is possible that there are sqst-1-dependent and independent autophagy pathways in C. elegans neurons. Such a possible sqst-1-independent autophagy pathway must, however, be lgg-1/Atg8-independent, since sqst-1 mutants were essentially void of GFP::LGG-1-positive punctae. To this point, it would be of interest to investigate neuronal roles for LGG-2, another Atg8 homolog in C. elegans, in future experiments. While sqst-1 was only required upon proteotoxic conditions, we show here that endogenous overexpression as well as neuronal overexpression of an autophagy receptor, SQST-1, led to long- evity at 20 \u00baC.", "Furthermore, SQST-1 overexpression was suf\ufb01cient to increase the mobility of neuronally expressed PolyQ proteins. This indicates that increased SQST-1 levels can change the nature of PolyQ proteins toward increased mobility, and thus possibly improved degradation. It will be interesting to determine how SQST-1 affects the biophysical properties of PolyQ proteins. One possibility could be that increased SQST-1 association with PolyQ aggregates modulates the nature of the aggregates, making them cytoprotective rather than detrimental for the cell as previously suggested9. Alternatively, it is possible that SQST-1 over- expression increases the degradation of PolyQ proteins, which could thus decrease the overall concentration and consequently increase the mobility of PolyQ proteins. Future experiments are needed to address these possibilities. We found that SQST-1-overexpressing animals have reduced levels of ubiquitinated proteins, which could be due to increased degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, or due to changes in the abundance or activity of ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinating enzymes. While we have not addressed the latter possibility, we found that SQST-1 overexpressing animals have increased pro- teasome activity, albeit modestly compared with germline-less glp-1 mutants48. This, in combination with the increased autop- hagy \ufb02ux in SQST-1-overexpressing animals, supports the idea that increasing SQST-1 levels increases protein degradation capabilities in C. elegans. Such increased protein degradation capabilities could contribute to the proteostasis and lifespan- extending bene\ufb01ts observed in these animals. Importantly, we demonstrate here that SQST-1 overexpression can improve pro- teostasis in a C. elegans neurodegenerative-disease model. p62 overexpression has been shown to alleviate symptoms in an Alzheimer\u2019s disease mouse model by the induction of autop- hagy10.", "We show that the improved proteostasis of animals with temperature-sensitive missense aggregation mutations similarly required autophagy genes, suggesting that autophagy, at least in part, is an important effector mechanism of the bene\ufb01cial effects of SQST-1 overexpression. Consistently, we showed that endogenous SQST-1 over- expression can lead to the induction of autophagy in neurons and the intestine. This leads to the question of how SQST-1 could mediate autophagosome induction. Recent \ufb01ndings point to the intriguing possibility that the presence of cargo can induce the formation of the autophagic isolation membranes55. This is supported by \ufb01ndings that p62 is present at the autophagosome- formation site before the interaction with LC3/Atg8 in mouse- embryonic \ufb01broblasts6,56. In addition, ubiquitinated cargo may directly contribute to the recruitment of the autophagy machin- ery57, and induce p62 phase separation and cargo segregation in vitro58. Thus, it seems plausible that ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate upon a hormetic HS in C. elegans, induce autophagy via recruitment of SQST-1. This suggests the possi- bility, that C. elegans neurons are prone to accumulate increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins under basal conditions that could be cleared more ef\ufb01ciently upon SQST-1 overexpression. Alter- natively, increased SQST-1 levels, particularly in neurons, could lead to the formation of ubiquitinated aggregates, which are somehow \u201cprimed\u201d for removal by autophagy, causing orga- nismal bene\ufb01ts. Since SQST-1 overexpression led to the formation of unusually large autophagosomes in neurons, it is similarly interesting to speculate on how SQST-1 could mediate autophagosome size. Studies in yeast have shown that the amount of Atg8 can regulate the size of autophagosomes by controlling the expansion of the phagophore59.", "Recent in vitro reconstitution models suggest that p62 oligomerization into \ufb01laments enables the formation of large clusters with ubiquitinated proteins that at the same time can interact with the isolation membrane55,60. This interaction facil- itates the bending of the membrane around the cargo55,60. Therefore, it is conceivable that increased SQST-1 protein levels could drive the formation of larger \ufb01laments and thus dictate the size of autophagosomes. It is possible that such larger autopha- gosomes are able to degrade ubiquitinated proteins, since SQST-1 overexpression reduced the steady-state levels of ubiquitinated proteins in C. elegans. Recent evidence suggests that the degra- dation of speci\ufb01c cargos by selective autophagy could be impor- tant for maintaining health3. It would therefore be interesting to further explore what the content of these larger autophagic structures is and their speci\ufb01c role in individual tissues, including in the pharynx in which SQST-1 overexpression caused a block in autophagy. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a central role of sqst-1 in HS-mediated homeostasis, illustrating a speci\ufb01c requirement for sqst-1 during proteotoxic stress. Moreover, overexpression of SQST-1 increased longevity and improved neuronal and intestinal proteostasis by inducing autophagy in C. elegans. [We note that while this paper was under revision, David Walker\u2019s group reported that adult overexpression of Ref(2)/p62 in Drosophila similarly extends lifespan in an autophagy- dependent manner61.] While our data support previous obser- vations showing that increasing p62 levels in neurodegenerative disease is bene\ufb01cial in mice10, accumulation of p62 in mammals can be cytotoxic in some tissues, and can have cancerous effects under speci\ufb01c circumstances15,62.", "Indeed, mammalian p62 is a NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2019) 10:5648 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13540-4 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 9 multifunctional protein involved in multiple cellular processes besides autophagy, such as several signal-transduction cascades, amino-acid sensing and the antioxidant response, that are mediated by additional protein domains not present in C. elegans SQST-163. Notably, the cancerous effects of p62 appear to be independent of the autophagy-related functions of p6262,64. Nevertheless, an increase in p62-mediated selective autophagy under cytotoxic conditions could be bene\ufb01cial and possibly counteract age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Methods Strains. Strains were maintained and cultured under standard conditions at 20 \u00b0C with the exception of autophagy measurements after hormetic heat shock, when animals were cultured at 15 \u00b0C65. For experiments with temperature-sensitive glp-1 (e2144) mutants, both glp-1(e2144) and wild-type (WT) N2 animals were allowed to hatch at 20 \u00b0C for 24 h and then moved to 25 \u00b0C until day 1 of adulthood. Escherichia coli OP50 was used as a food source unless RNAi was initiated. For RNAi experiments, animals were grown on HT115 bacteria from the time of RNAi initiation (see below). See Supplementary Data 4 for strains used in and created for this study. RNA interference. Gene inactivation was achieved by feeding C. elegans with RNAi bacterial clones expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting the gene of interest. Clones were obtained from the Ahringer RNAi library (cup-5, epg- 5, lgg-1/Atg8, vps-34, cyc-1, nuo-6) or the Vidal RNAi library (atg-18, bec-1/ATG6). The let-363 and daf-2 RNAi clones and the empty vector (L4440) for controls were provided by Drs. J. Avruch, A. Dillin, and A. Fire, respectively. All RNAi clones were veri\ufb01ed by sequencing.", "For RNAi experiments, HT115 bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid culture medium containing 0.1 mg ml\u22121 carbenicillin (Carb; BioPioneer) and 80 \u03bcl aliquots of bacterial suspension were spotted onto 6 cm nematode growth medium (NGM) containing 0.1 mg ml\u22121 Carb (NGM/Carb plates). Bacteria were allowed to grow for 1\u20132 days. For induction of dsRNA expression, 80 \u03bcl of a solution containing 0.1 M isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (Promega/Gold Biotechnology) and 500 mg ml\u22121 Carb was placed directly onto the lawn. For two generations of RNAi, animals were synchronized by hypochlorous acid treatment or eggs were manually transferred onto NGM plates seeded with dsRNA-expressing HT115 bacteria, once these animals reached adulthood, their progeny was transferred onto NGM plates seeded with dsRNA-expressing HT115 bacteria. For whole-life RNAi, animals were synchronized by hypochlorous acid treatment or eggs were manually transferred onto NGM plates seeded with dsRNA-expressing HT115 bacteria. For adult-only RNAi, animals were synchro- nized by hypochlorous acid treatment and eggs were allowed to hatch on NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. On day 1 of adulthood, animals were transferred to NGM/Carb plates seeded with dsRNA-expressing or control bacteria. Autophagy measurements. Autophagy was monitored by counting GFP-positive LGG-1/Atg8 punctae in body-wall muscle, proximal intestinal cells, and terminal pharyngeal bulb of strain DA2123, MAH693, MAH925, MAH236, MAH864, RD202, and MAH711. Autophagy was monitored in the nerve-ring neurons of strain MAH242, MAH690, MAH944, MAH855, MAH856, MAH744, MAH779, MAH785, and MAH904. See Supplementary Data 4 for genotypes and strain information. For hormetic HS experiments, animals were raised at 15 \u00b0C and subjected to HS for 1 h at 36 \u00b0C. For all other experiments, animals were raised at 20 \u00b0C.", "For autophagic \ufb02ux assays, ba\ufb01lomycin A1 (BafA) (BioViotica) or vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO) was injected into gfp::lgg-1/ATG8-expressing animals on day 1 of adulthood40. BafA was resuspended in DMSO to a stock concentration of 25 \u03bcM. The co-injection dye Texas Red Dextran 3000 MW (Molecular Probes) was resuspended in water to a stock concentration of 25 mg ml\u22121. A 100 \u03bcM BafA working solution was prepared by adding 1 \u03bcl of the 25 mM BafA stock solution to 249 \u03bcl of water. The 50 \u03bcM BafA injection solution was prepared by mixing 5 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcM BafA with 1 \u03bcl of the 25 mg ml\u22121 co-injection dye with 4 \u03bcl of water. A 0.2% DMSO injection solution containing the co-injection dye was prepared the same way. The BafA or DMSO injection solution was injected into the anterior intestinal area or close to the terminal pharyngeal bulb and animals were allowed to recover on NGM plates with OP50 for 2 h. Surviving animals that scored positive for the red dye were used for GFP::LGG-1 punctae quanti\ufb01cation. For imaging and punctae quanti\ufb01cation, animals were mounted on a 2% agarose pad in M9 medium containing 0.1% NaN3 and GFP::LGG-1/Atg8 punctae were counted using a Zeiss Imager Z1 including apotome.2 with a Hamamatsu orca \ufb02ash 4LT camera and Zen 2.3 software. The total number of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8- positive punctae was counted in body-wall muscle, the three to four most proximal intestinal cells or the terminal pharyngeal bulb at \u00d71000 magni\ufb01cation. For imaging and punctae quanti\ufb01cation of the nerve-ring neurons, Z-stack images were acquired at 1.0 \u03bcm slice intervals. At least 8\u201310 animals were imaged for each condition and results were combined from three independent experiments and analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA as applicable (GraphPad Prism). The size of autophagic structures was determined by tracing the outline of GFP::LGG-1/Atg8-positive punctae from acquired images using ImageJ.", "Histograms of diameters of autophagic structures binned by diameter were made using GraphPad Prism. Thermorecovery assays. For each strain, four 6 cm NGM plates with 20\u201340 animals per plate were incubated in a single layer in a HERAtherm incubator (ThermoFisher) at 36 \u00b0C for 7 h. Animal survival was measured after 7 h at 36 \u00b0C followed by a \u2018recovery\u2019 period of 20 h at 20 \u00b0C. Survival was assessed by scoring the animals\u2019 voluntary movement. For hormetic HS, animals were incubated at 36 \u00b0C for 1 h on day 1 of adulthood and incubated for 7 h at 36 \u00b0C on day 3 of adulthood. The average percentage survival and s.e.m. were calculated and the data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA as applicable (GraphPad Prism). Lifespan analysis. Lifespan was measured at 20 \u00b0C using six 6 cm NGM or NGM/ Carb plates seeded with OP50 bacteria or dsRNA-expressing bacteria with 15\u201320 animals per plate. The L4 larval stage was recorded as day 0 of the lifespan and animals were transferred at least every other day to new 6 cm NGM plates throughout the reproductive period. For RNAi experiments, feeding with dsRNA- expressing or control bacteria was initiated on day 1 of adulthood unless indicated otherwise. For hormetic HS, animals were incubated at 36 \u00b0C for 1 h on day 1 of adulthood. Animals were scored as dead if they failed to respond to gentle prod- ding with a platinum-wire pick. Censoring occurred if animals desiccated on the edge of the plate, escaped, ruptured or suffered from internal hatching. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software (StataCorp) or Oasis 266. P-values were calculated with the log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) method. See Supplementary Tables 2\u20135 and Supplementary Data 1\u20133 for a summary of all lifespan experiments. For methodology on healthspan parameters see Supplementary Methods. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The mobility of PolyQ aggregates was assayed using FRAP on a Nikon A1R HD confocal microscope67.", "Animals were either subjected to a hormetic HS (36 \u00b0C, 1 h) on day 1 of adulthood, or maintained at control conditions (20 \u00b0C). For FRAP of neuronal Q40::YFP, animals were aged until day 8 of adulthood, for FRAP of intestinal Q44::YFP and muscle Q35::YFP, animals on day 3 of adulthood were used. For FRAP Animals were anaesthetized with M9 medium containing 0.1% NaN3 and aggregated and diffuse PolyQ::YFP was bleached with 100% power of a 405 nm laser for 3.6 s (neurons) or 5.83 s (muscle and intestine). Recovery was monitored for a duration of 2 min, with measurements every 30 s (neurons) or every 10 s (muscle and intestine) with 1% of a 488 nm laser. Fluorescence intensity was relative to pre- bleach intensity and a non-bleached area as well as a non-\ufb02uorescent background was monitored and corrected for. At least 30 animals were imaged for each con- dition and results were combined from three independent experiments and ana- lyzed using two-way ANOVA (GraphPad Prism). Analysis of PolyQ strains and temperature-sensitive mutants. The number of neuronal PolyQ aggregates was counted in individual animals of strains AM101, MAH755, MAH876 and MAH877 (f+r on days 2\u201314 of adulthood. The number of intestinal PolyQ aggregates was counted in individual animals of strains MAH602 and MAH691 on days 2\u20135 of adulthood. The number of muscle PolyQ aggregates was counted in individual animals of strains AM140 and MAH745 on days 2\u20133 of adulthood. See Supplementary Data 4 for genotypes and strain information. Ani- mals were raised and maintained at 20 \u00b0C. For hormetic HS animals were raised at 20 \u00b0C and then maintained under control conditions or subjected to HS for 1 h at 36 \u00b0C on day 1 of adulthood. Animals were imaged on NGM plates without food after anaesthetization with M9 medium containing 0.1% NaN3. Images were acquired with a Leica DFC310 FX camera. Aggregates were counted using the \u2018Cell counter\u2019 function of ImageJ software. Averages and s.e.m.", "were calculated and the data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (GraphPad Prism). For methodology on paralysis measurements of temperature-sensitive mutants, see Supplementary Methods. Imaging of \ufb02uorescent reporter strains. For images of higher magni\ufb01cation (including for colocalization of SQST-1::GFP and tdTOMATO::LGG-1/Atg8), animals were mounted on a 2% agarose pad in M9 medium containing 0.1% NaN3 and imaged on a Zeiss Imager Z1 including apotome.2 with a Hamamatsu orca \ufb02ash 4LT camera and Zen 2.3 software at \u00d71000 magni\ufb01cation. For colocalization, images were analyzed using the colocalization plugin Coloc2 in Fiji-ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The correlation between the red and green \ufb02uor- escence is given as intensity correlation quotient (ICQ) values68. For random or mixed patterns of \ufb02uorescence intensity of the red and green channel this number will tend toward 0, for segregated localization of the red and green \ufb02uorescence signal the ICQ score will tend toward \u22120.5, and for colocalization of the \ufb02uorescent signals, the ICQ score will tend toward +0.5.

In line with this, aging is the primary risk factor for the development of many dis- orders, including cardiovascular disease (for example, stroke), cancer and neurodegenerative disease (for example, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)). Collectively, age-related ailments represent a for- midable global socioeconomic burden and a significant health- care challenge2,3. Therefore, identifying therapeutic interventions that promote \u2018healthy aging\u2019 (that is, the maintenance of func- tional ability in old age, enabling older individuals to inde- pendently carry out daily tasks) and simultaneously halt the progression of multiple age-related pathological conditions is of paramount importance2. Among the many molecular changes associated with old age, altered autophagy has emerged as a feature of aging across diverse species. However, recent advances in understanding the numer- ous substrates of autophagy and the temporal and spatial effects of impaired autophagy regulation on tissue homeostasis have revealed a complex and multifactorial relationship between autophagy and aging. Here we examine the relationship among autophagy, aging and disease and propose novel links between specific autophagic processes and long-term tissue health, as well as possible implica- tions for anti-aging therapeutic interventions.", "Compromised autophagy is a hallmark of aging Research over the last decade has revealed that the process of autophagy can take many different forms. Autophagy (from the Greek words auto, meaning \u2018self\u2019, and phagein, meaning \u2018to eat\u2019) is a highly conserved pathway that degrades cellular components, such as defective organelles and aggregates of misfolded protein4, through lysosomes. The process of autophagy was first described in the 1960s, but it was the identification of autophagy-related genes (ATG genes) in the 1990s that propelled major breakthroughs in unravelling the mechanistic complexities of autophagy5\u201312. There are three major types of autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) (Fig. 1a\u2013c), all of which involve delivery of substrates to the lysosome for degradation (see detailed reviews in refs. 13,14). Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) was originally thought of as a nonselective bulk degradation process (Fig. 1a, pathway (1)). However, the discovery of selective autophagy receptors, among which p62/SQSTM1 was the first, changed this notion15,16. Today, autophagy is recognized as a highly selective cellular clearance pathway that is associated with Autophagy in healthy aging and disease Yahyah Aman1,2,22, Tomas Schmauck-Medina 1,22, Malene Hansen3, Richard I.

While autophagy is intimately linked to health, the intricate relationship among autophagy, aging and disease remains unclear.", "This Review examines several emerging features of autophagy and postulates how they may be linked to aging as well as to the development and progression of disease. In addition, we discuss current preclinical evidence arguing for the use of autophagy modulators as suppressors of age-related pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we highlight key questions and propose novel research avenues that will likely reveal new links between autophagy and the hallmarks of aging. Understanding the precise interplay between autophagy and the risk of age-related pathologies across organisms will eventu- ally facilitate the development of clinical applications that promote long-term health.

Selective autophagy can be further divided into many subtypes on the basis of the specific cargos involved. These subtypes target various macro- molecules (glycophagy and lipophagy) (Fig. 1a, pathways (2)\u2013(5)), mitochondria (mitophagy) (Fig. 1a, pathway (6)), the endoplas- mic reticulum (ER) (ER-phagy) (Fig. 1a, pathway (7)), parts of the nucleus (nucleophagy) (Fig. 1a, pathway (8)), pathogens (xenoph- agy) (Fig. 1a, pathway (9)) and lysosomes themselves (lysophagy) (Fig. 1a, pathway (10)). Below we will discuss the links among these selective autophagy pathways, aging and disease. The core process of autophagy has been described in detail elsewhere14,19. However, in brief, the core process is initiated following inhibition of mechanis- tic target of rapamycin (mTOR) or activation of 5\u2032 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), both of which are canonical inducers of autophagy in response to stress (for example, starvation or elevated temperatures) and physical exercise.", "In addition, transcription factor EB (TFEB) is an important positive regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis whose nuclear translocation is coupled to the activity of both mTOR (via phosphorylation) and AMPK (via folliculin (FLCN))20\u201323. Upon activation of autophagy, the process is initiated by membrane nucleation and phagophore formation fol- lowed by elongation and maturation before autophagosome fusion with the lysosome for cargo degradation and recycling. The key pro- teins involved in each step are presented in Fig. 2. A growing body of evidence suggests that autophagic activity declines with age in diverse organisms1. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans, rodents and human cells have demonstrated an age-depen- dent reduction in lysosomal proteolytic function that thereby impairs autophagic flux24\u201327, exacerbating cellular impairment and contributing to the development of age-related diseases1,28,29. Further evidence stemming from Drosophila has demonstrated that aging is associated with reduced expression of several Atg genes (Atg2, Atg8a and bchs (encoding blue cheese)), which are pivotal for both autophagy initiation and activity30. In aged wild-type mice, autoph- agy is diminished in neuronal cells, as evidenced by decreased rates of autophagolysosomal fusion and impaired delivery of autophagy substrates to lysosomes in the hypothalamus31. Moreover, a decrease in autophagic processes was observed in brain tissue from 18- to 25-month-old mice, as demonstrated by a reduction in the levels of Atg5\u2013Atg12 and Becn1, elevated mTOR activity and increased levels of ferritin H (ferritin H is mainly removed from cells by the autoph- agy\u2013lysosome pathway)32. In addition, emerging evidence in aged rats has highlighted an age-associated decline in expression of the autophagy-related protein beclin 1 (BECN1) in whole brain tissue, as well as in the hippocampus of naked mole rats and Wistar rats33,34.", "In line with observations in rodent models, findings in humans have suggested that the expression of autophagy-related genes, such as ATG5, ATG7 and BECN1, declines with age35. Moreover, the devel- opment and progression of several human pathologies is highly associated with age-dependent autophagy deficits19,36,37. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that a gradual decline in the abundance of autophagy-related proteins and reduced delivery of cargo to lyso- somes occur with age, implicating compromised autophagy as a car- dinal feature of organismal aging. In line with a causal role for autophagy in the aging process14, genetically impairing nonselective or selective autophagy results in accelerated tissue functional decline and disease in a range of experimental models. Transcriptomic profiling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has provided evidence of defective autophagy among short-lived as compared to long-lived mutants38. In addition, selec- tive mutation(s) and/or knockdown of genes encoding compo- nents of the autophagic machinery in C. elegans (lgg-1 (ortholog of Fig. 1 | Different mechanisms of autophagy. a, Macroautophagy (referred to herein as autophagy) (1) is a nonselective process that targets macromolecules or subcellular organelles in bulk. Cytoplasmic material is sequestered into an autophagosome and delivered to the lysosome (or endolysosome) for degradation). Selective autophagy involves recognition of specific cytoplasmic cargo via autophagy receptors that also interact with LC3 in the autophagic membrane, leading to cargo sequestration into autophagosomes that are delivered to a lysosome (or endolysosome) for degradation.", "This includes aggrephagy (2), where aggregated proteins are ubiquitinated and targeted by ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptors such as p62 (or NBR1); glycophagy (3), where STBD1 (genethonin-1) binds to glycogen and GABARAP, facilitating lysosomal glycogen breakdown into non- phosphorylated glucose by enzymes such as GAA; lipophagy (4), in which lysosomal lipids are degraded into free fatty acids, which are then converted into ATP; the identity of the receptor(s) (yellow) involved in sequestration of lipid droplets is unknown;; granulophagy (5), where sequestration of stress granules (RNA + protein) is mediated by Cdc48/VCP, allowing the stress granule to be delivered to the lysosome for degradation; mitophagy (6), where damaged mitochondria are bound by soluble or membrane-bound mitophagy receptors (mReceptors) that can also bind LC3, leading to engulfment of the mitochondrion into an autophagosome and subsequent delivery to a lysosome for degradation (left); in piecemeal mitophagy, degradation of parts of mitochondria occurs via binding of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein metaxin-1 (MTX1, in the extruded fraction) to LC3C, resulting in the recruitment of p62 and autophagosome formation (right); ER-phagy (7), which in mammals uses the specific receptors FAM134B, RTN3L, ATL3, SEC62, CCPG1 and TEX264, which are located in different parts of the ER; these receptors bind to LC3, leading to sequestration of the ER into an autophagosome and lysosomal degradation of the", "ER; nucleophagy (8), which, when triggered in mammals, results in nuclear LC3 binding to lamin B1, leading to formation of a bulge that is pinched off to the cytoplasm where degradation by autophagy occurs; xenophagy (type A, 9), where a bacterium\u2019s DNA is detected by cGAS, a sensor that triggers a process of ubiquitination via Smurf1; this is followed by attachment of the NBR1 receptor to the ubiquitin chains and LC3 to continue the autophagy process for degradation of the bacterium; xenophagy (type B, 10), where a bacterium damages the membrane of the phagosome, exposing interior glycans that recruit galectin-8 (Gal-8), which is then recognized by NDP52 to recruit TBK1, LC3C, Nap and Sintbad; the optineurin, p62 and NDP52 receptors interact with ubiquitin on the pathogen and recruit the autophagic engulfment system, and the engulfed pathogen is then brought for degradation; and lysophagy (11), which occurs upon lysosomal membrane permeabilization and can be achieved with or without ubiquitination: recruitment of galectin-3 (Gal-3) to damaged lysosomes further recruits TRIM16 and autophagic proteins such as ULK1 and ATG16L1, and ubiquitination on the lysosome results in the recruitment of p62, which binds to LC3 to facilitate the autophagic process (left); in a parallel ubiquitin-independent process, galectin-8 is recruited to damaged lysosomes and is capable of directly binding to the NDP52 receptor that interacts with LC3 to continue the autophagic process (right). b, Microautophagy involves capture of cytoplasmic components through direct invagination of endolysosome membranes and can be nonspecific (bulk) (12) or highly specific (13,14). Examples of selective microautophagy in mammalian cells include micro-ER-phagy (13), which uses the SEC62 receptor and involves ER capture and degradation by invagination of the lysosome/endolysosome, and endosomal microautophagy of proteins with the KFERQ pentapeptide motif (14) in a process requiring the chaperone HSC70.", "c, CMA (15) also involves targeting of proteins containing a KFERQ pentapeptide-related motif by HSC70 and other co-chaperones such as HSP40. The substrate is then imported into the lysosome through the LAMP2A receptor for further degradation. The LAMP2A receptor is modulated by the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Finally, in a CMA-like manner, DNAutophagy/RNAutophagy (16) can occur: nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) bind to the LAMP2C receptor (orange), which also binds to lysosomes. This process allows nucleic acids to be taken up by the lysosome. It has been proposed that a transporter called SIDT2 (green) might have a role in direct uptake of nucleic acids by the lysosome.

In line with these observations, systemic genetic knockout of autophagy com- ponents (Becn1, Atg5, Atg9 and Atg13) is lethal in mice, highlight- ing the importance of autophagy in development40. Furthermore, knockdown of genes encoding transcription factors that regulate autophagy, such as TFEB (ortholog in C. elegans, hlh-30) and FOXO (encoding forkhead box O; ortholog in C. elegans, daf-16) shortened lifespan in both wild-type worms and long-lived daf-2 (insulin/ insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor) mutants41. In contrast, studies in long-lived mutant animals have shown that increased autophagy is associated with delayed aging. In par- ticular, the extended lifespan of C. elegans daf-2 loss-of-function mutants is dependent on autophagic genes, such as bec-1, lgg-1, atg- 7 and atg-12 (refs. 1,14,42).", "Furthermore, HLH-30 is required for the long lifespan of multiple longevity mutants, including not only daf-2 mutants with reduced insulin/insulin-like signaling, but also germ- line-less glp-1(e2141) mutants, dietary-restricted eat-2(ad1116) mutants, mitochondrial respiration-defective clk-1(e2519) mutants and mRNA translation-impaired rsks-1(sv31) mutants43. These findings coincide with impaired induction of autophagosome for- mation and lysosomal degradation upon loss of hlh-30, suggest- ing that HLH-30 promotes longevity by regulating the autophagy process downstream of multiple lifespan extension paradigms43. In addition, formation of long-lived dauer worms, corresponding to a larval hibernation stage, is also associated with increased autophagy and is dependent on the autophagy genes atg-1, atg-7, lgg-1 and atg- 18, underlining the essential role of autophagy in organismal adap- tation during challenging conditions42.

Autophagy induction by overexpression of Atg genes in Drosophila (Atg1 and Atg8a) and mice (Atg5) extends lifespan30,44,45. Similarly, Bcl2 mutations that disrupt the BECN1\u2013BCL-2 complex increase basal autophagic flux, which results in long-lived male and female mice with improved healthspan46. Overexpression of autophagic regulators in C. elegans and Drosophila, such as AMPK, further facilitates autophagy in diverse tissues and in turn extends longevity14,45. Additionally, hlh-30 overexpression enhances autoph- agy and promotes lifespan extension in C. elegans43, and silencing of the nuclear export protein exportin-1 (XPO-1) enhances autophagy by enrichment of HLH-30 in the nucleus, which is accompanied by proteostatic benefits and improved longevity47. Moreover, rapamy- cin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, has been shown to extend the median and maximum lifespan of both female and male mice when fed to them late in life48. Accumulating evidence in aged mice, as well as in rodent models recapitulating characteristic features of human diseases, has shown that compromised autophagy is among the most common factors contributing to the collapse of tissue homeostasis. In particular, age- associated dysregulation of autophagy (demonstrated by the accu- mulation of autophagosomes), possibly due to impaired lysosomal fusion and/or degradation, is associated with cellular dysfunction and/or death, which contribute to neurodegeneration, as well as cardiac and skeletal muscle aging49\u201353.", "In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), autophagy has been shown to delay aging via activation of downstream sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), a key mitochondrial protein capable of rejuvenating blood and protecting against oxidative stress in mice and human HSC-enriched cells54. Moreover, autophagy appears to be a critical mechanism to maintain immune memory in mice, and levels of the endogenous autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine fall in human T cells with age. In fact, supplementation of T cells from older donors with spermidine restores autophagy levels to those observed in younger donors via the eIF5A translation factor and TFEB transcription fac- tor55. Furthermore, spermidine administration in a mouse model of mild cognitive impairment, a transitional phase between healthy aging and AD, led to an improvement in degradation of misfolded proteins and an accompanying delay in age-related memory defi- cits, thereby implicating autophagy as a pathophysiological mecha- nism of action56. While dysregulation of autophagy underlies aging and disease phenotypes, excessive autophagy may also contribute to the dete- rioration of cellular function in some contexts. Recent evidence has demonstrated that an age-dependent decline in the levels of Rubicon, a negative regulator of autophagy, exacerbates metabolic disorders in adipocytes57. While strongly upregulated autophagy may exacerbate metabolic disorders, this finding may also be attributed to autophagy-independent changes in metabolism. Furthermore, elevated autophagy has been found to shorten lifes- pan in C. elegans mutants lacking sgk-1 (encoding serum/glucocor- ticoid-regulated kinase-1). Loss of this kinase results in increased mitochondrial permeability, leading to excessive autophagy and reduced organismal fitness in worms and mice58. Conversely, reduc- ing the levels of autophagy in sgk-1 mutants or suppressing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore restores normal lifespan58.", "Similarly, suppressing autophagy exclusively in the intestine of post-reproductive adults at higher temperatures has been proposed to prevent the emergence of age-related pathologies in C. elegans59. However, it should be noted that this is in direct con- trast to findings in long-lived mutants, where intestinal autophagy is enhanced60,61. Another study in C. elegans showed that short interfering RNA (siRNA)-based reduction in the abundance of the Initiation Nucleation Elongation Maturation Fusion with lysosome Degradation ATG101 FIP200 P P P P P ATG13 ULK1 mTOR AMPK BECN1 VPS34 AMBRA1 ATG14L VPS15 ER ATG4 p62 HOPS complex ATG7 ATG3 p62 p62 PE BCL-2 PtdIns3P pool WIPI proteins 1 2 RAB7 SNARE complex AR AR AR Vesicles with ATG9 Acidic hydrolases ATG2 ATG18 LC3-II ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1 LC3-I for recycling Lysosome LC3-I LC3-I LC3 LC3 ATG4 Fig. 2 | Core machinery of autophagy. Initiation of autophagy requires the ULK1 kinase complex, which is tightly regulated by AMPK and mTOR, which act as an activator and inhibitor, respectively. AMPK activates ULK1 through phosphorylation. The ULK1 complex, composed of FIP200, ATG13 and ATG101, stimulates the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3C3) complex, which is composed of BECN1 (which can be inhibited by BCL-2), AMBRA1, ATG14L, VPS15 and VPS34. This complex then produces a pool of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), which leads to the recruitment of WIPI proteins, which recover ATG9-positive vesicles from previous membranes, as well as recruiting the ATG5\u2013ATG12\u2013ATG16L1 (E3) complex. LC3 is first cleaved by the ATG4 protease to form cytosolic LC3-I, which is further recognized by E1 (ATG7), E2 (ATG3) and E3 components, leading to its conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). After this process, LC3-I is referred to as LC3-II.

However, detailed data on knockdown efficiency in aged worms, as well as an understanding of the remaining levels of neuronal autophagy, are necessary to ensure accurate in-depth data interpretation. Collectively, these observations suggest that mainte- nance of functional autophagy is essential for healthy cellular and organismal aging and that dysregulation of autophagy in either direction, whether insufficient or excessive, contributes to cellular deficits and functional organismal decline. A summary of autophagy-related genes linked to longevity and disease is provided in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1. In addi- tion, several interventions known to promote lifespan, including dietary restriction and treatment with pharmacological agents, such as rapamycin, spermidine and NAD+ precursors, require intact autophagic machinery. In totality, these findings reinforce the notion that autophagy stimulation is necessary and sufficient to sustain organismal homeostasis and extend longevity in mul- tiple model organisms (discussed in detail below)1. An overview of autophagy inducers linked to enhanced longevity and improved health is presented in Table 2.", "Together, numerous studies have provided evidence that (1) autophagy is compromised during the process of aging; (2) dysfunc- tion of autophagy shortens lifespan in various experimental animal models; and (3) promotion or restoration of autophagy contributes to lifespan and healthspan extension in diverse organisms. This suggests that autophagy is a central regulator of aging. However, an important and fundamental question remains unanswered: how does autophagy facilitate long-term cell and tissue health? The multifaceted role of autophagy in health and aging Autophagy and protein homeostasis. Protein homeostasis (pro- teostasis) collapse is a central hallmark of aging and disease that is characterized by the appearance of misfolded, mislocalized and aggregated proteins. While age-related loss of proteostasis has been documented in numerous tissues, age-dependent protein aggrega- tion is strongly linked to neurodegenerative pathologies such as AD, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)62,63. Along with molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS), autophagy is a central regulator of cellular proteos- tasis that operates to (1) degrade soluble misfolded or oligomeric proteins via CMA (the selective degradation of ubiquitin-tagged protein aggregates by chaperone-assisted selective autophagy) and (2) remove bulk protein aggregates13,19,64. In line with this, genetic perturbation of core components or regulators of the autophagy machinery accelerates age-related protein aggregation, shortens lifespan and exacerbates pathological features in worm, fly and mouse models of disease. Conversely, increasing autophagy, geneti- cally or pharmacologically, suppresses protein aggregation and pro- motes health and longevity48,65,66 (also reviewed in refs. 67\u201369).", "In C. elegans, loss-of-function mutations in bec-1 or atg-18 or RNA interference (RNAi) against bec-1, atg-9 or lgg-1 increases susceptibility to protein aggregation, accelerates the onset of age- related paralysis and shortens lifespan39,70. Similarly, mutations in the core autophagy components Atg8a or Atg7 in Drosophila increase the levels of insoluble protein aggregates and reduce lon- gevity30,71. Finally, knockout of Atg5 or Atg7 in mouse neurons leads to the appearance of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the brain and early-onset neurodegeneration72\u201374, while knockout of Lamp2 (the primary receptor for CMA) in the liver results in altered proteosta- sis and hepatic dysfunction with age75. Conversely, enhanced proteostasis and extended lifespan in C. elegans occur when the lysosome\u2013autophagy transcription fac- tor HLH-30 or the selective autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM-1 is upregulated. Likewise, in Drosophila, overexpression of Ref(2)P (p62 ortholog) or the autophagy activator FOXO reduces protein aggre- gation in various tissues and extends lifespan43,76\u201379. Pharmacological (for example, via clonidine, rilmenidine or rapamycin) or genetic (for example, atg5) upregulation of autophagy in zebrafish harbor- ing the rare p.Ala152Thr variant of tau ameliorates tau pathology80. Increased autophagy is also associated with enhanced clearance of protein aggregates in mammals, as systemic overexpression of Atg5 or Becn1 genes with mutations that disrupt BECN1\u2013BCL-2 bind- ing improves proteostasis and promotes longevity in mice44,81, while overexpression of the selective autophagy mediator BAG3 sup- presses tau accumulation in neurons82. As a complement to the genetic modulation of autophagy, treatment of Drosophila with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin sup- presses age-related protein aggregation and extends lifespan in an autophagy-dependent manner83.", "Furthermore, in cell culture and fly models, rapamycin suppresses toxicity from neurodegen- erative disease-associated proteins, including mutant huntingtin, polyalanine-expansion-containing proteins and tau84. Several other pharmacological autophagy inducers, such as spermidine and nico- tinamide, have also been reported to protect against proteostasis collapse and proteotoxicity in various models of Huntington\u2019s dis- ease, AD, Parkinson\u2019s disease and ALS67. Autophagy has also been linked to stem cell function, with the autophagy-mediated clearance of protein aggregates central to the activation of quiescent neuronal stem cells. Activating autophagy by overexpression of TFEB or rapamycin supplementation inhibits age-related protein aggregation and enhances neuronal and muscle stem cell function in aged mice85\u201387. Given the fact that stem cell exhaustion is intimately linked to age-related tissue dysfunction, these findings suggest that enhancing proteostasis specifically in stem cells may preserve many aspects of healthy tissue function during aging. Collectively, these observations strongly support the notion that autophagy promotes healthy aging by protecting cells against toxic misfolded and aggregated proteins. Autophagy regulation of macromolecule availability. Another important role for autophagy in cellular homeostasis and organ- ismal aging is to ensure the availability of metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, especially dur- ing states of stress, such as nutrient starvation (Fig. 1a). Under chal- lenging conditions, autophagy promotes cellular metabolism and survival by recycling amino acids, which are generated from the degradation of cytosolic substrates, to replenish nutrients, produce energy and promote protein synthesis.", "An inability to properly recy- cle amino acids through autophagy is linked to growth and develop- mental defects in Atg5-deficient mice and impaired growth during nitrogen starvation in several atg-deficient yeast cell lines (includ- ing atg1\u0394, atg2\u0394, atg7\u0394, atg11\u0394, atg15\u0394 and atg32\u0394 mutants) 88\u201390. Autophagy can also be tailored to mediate the availability of carbo- hydrates, lipids and nucleic acids through three main cellular pro- cesses: glycophagy, lipophagy and RNAutophagy or DNAutophagy, respectively. Glycophagy. Glucose is the primary energy source for cellular metab- olism. It is stored as glycogen, and metabolism of glucose is tightly regulated in a tissue-dependent manner (that is, the liver main- tains blood glucose levels, while muscles are the source of cellular energy). However, various conditions resulting in metabolic stress, such as starvation, stimulate glycogen breakdown to augment cel- lular glucose levels and promote metabolic activity91. Glycogen can be degraded in the cytosol through the activity of glycogen phos- phorylase and glycogen debranching enzymes (detailed in ref. 92) or in the lysosome via autophagy. The selective clearance of gly- cogen via autophagy, referred to as glycophagy, has a crucial role in glucose homeostasis. In response to nutrient deficiency, the energy sensor AMPK is activated, which in turn inhibits mTOR NATuRE AGING | VOL 1 | AUGUST 2021 | 634\u2013650 | www.nature.com/nataging 639 Review ARticle NATURe AgINg complex 1 (mTORC1), leading to activation of the ULK1 kinase, which is important for induction of autophagy (AMPK\u2013mTORC1\u2013 ULK1 triad)91. Recent findings in yeast have demonstrated that Atg11 is necessary to facilitate interaction between the AMPK homolog Snf1 and the ULK1 homolog Atg1 upon glucose starvation to promote autophagy93.", "The LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, also known in yeast as the Atg8-family-interacting motif (AIM), in starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 (STBD1) may allow cells to physically link glycogen to GABARAPL1, facilitat- ing the transport of glycogen to lysosomes for degradation (Fig. 1a, pathway (3))94. In parallel to glycophagy, other pathways such as \u03b2-oxidation may maintain cellular bioenergetics to compensate for glucose deprivation95. Autophagy also has a pivotal role in main- taining cell function, not only in glucose starvation but also in con- ditions of excess glucose. High glucose levels were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, generation of reactive oxygen species and induction of autophagy in endothelial progenitor cells96. Under conditions of impaired autophagy, accumulation of gly- cogen contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related diseases. In Pompe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder, the ability of lyso- somes to degrade glycogen is impaired, owing to a deficiency in the lysosomal hydrolytic enzyme acid \u03b1-glucosidase (GAA). This results in accumulation of lysosomal glycogen in many tissues, predominantly in skeletal and cardiac muscle, leading to progres- sive lethal skeletal myopathy and respiratory and cardiac defects97. Impaired tissue function from the inability of lysosomes to degrade glycogen also leads to energy deficiency in skeletal muscle. For infantile-onset Pompe disease98, a promising therapeutic interven- tion is administration of recombinant human GAA. Furthermore, dysfunctional autophagy-mediated accumulation of glycogen has been demonstrated to be the cause of neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Lafora disease, with this accumulation suppressed when glycogen synthase is deleted99. These findings indicate that glyco- gen accumulation might be a cause, rather than a consequence, of impaired autophagy, resulting in impaired cellular function and disease.", "Glycophagy, therefore, is essential for cellular function and survival, suggesting that levels of glycophagy could determine organismal health and possibly longevity. Lipophagy. Intracellular storage and use of lipids is critical to main- tain cellular energy homeostasis. In response to starvation, triglyc- erides stored in lipid droplets are hydrolyzed by specific lipases into free fatty acids for energy metabolism. Lipid droplets can also undergo selective degradation by autophagy, termed lipophagy, as an alternative mechanism for regulating lipid homeostasis (Fig. 1a, pathway (4))100. Thus far, a specific receptor coupling lipid droplets to autophagosomes and trafficking to lysosomes has not yet been identified, although LC3-mediated engulfment of lipid droplets has been observed101. Moreover, CMA has been implicated in degrada- tion of the lipid droplet-associated proteins perilipin 2 (PLIN2) and perilipin 3 (PLIN3)102. Lysosomal acid lipases are involved in the degradation of lipid droplets; in particular, lipolysis is conducted primarily by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL), and selective knockdown of ATGL and HSL in mice results in selective inhibition of lipid droplet degradation, while other autophagy processes (that is, degradation of proteins and organelles) serve as a compensatory mechanism to replenish the reduced availability of energy substrates103. An age-dependent decline in basal autophagy in the liver may underlie the accumu- lation of hepatic lipids, which in turn has been proposed to con- tribute to metabolic conditions as well as impairing autophagy, a vicious cycle promoting aging100. For example, age-dependent reduction in CMA is likely due to alterations in the lipid composi- tion of discrete microdomains at the lysosomal membrane, includ- ing altered dynamics and stability of the CMA receptor LAMP2A in the lysosome104.", "Additional mechanisms by which age-related alterations in lipid composition and/or levels may impair autophagy remain unknown. Further, age-dependent accrual of lipid droplets and ectopic fat deposition are highly interconnected with the age- dependent decline in autophagy and/or autophagic defects105,106. Autophagy and LIPL-4-dependent lipolysis are both upregulated in germline-less C. elegans and work interdependently to prolong lifespan107. The mammalian homolog of worm LIPL-4 is lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), a key enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of cho- lesterol via autophagy108,109.

In pathological conditions such as alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), impaired lipophagy has been shown to be the basis of lipid peroxidation and cellular damage. AFLD results from exces- sive consumption of alcohol, leading to damage to the liver in the form of oxidative stress, excessive lipid droplet accumulation in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes (steatosis), mitochondrial damage and cell death. Acute exposure to ethanol triggers lipophagy, which acts as a defense mechanism against lipid peroxidation, thereby pro- tecting hepatocytes. However, chronic exposure to ethanol leads to mTOR-mediated inhibition of lipophagy, which in turn contrib- utes to lipid peroxidation and cell death22,113,114.", "In fact, inhibition of mTOR-mediated suppression of TFEB, using torin-1, resulted in enrichment of TFEB levels in the liver and protection against ste- atosis and ethanol-induced liver injury115. Genetic overexpression of TFEB in the liver was shown to increase lysosomal biogenesis and enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics, which served as a pro- tective mechanism against ethanol-induced liver injury in mice. In line with these findings, knockdown of TFEB in the liver of mice resulted in more severe liver injury in response to increased ethanol consumption115. In addition, lipophagy is key for the differentiation of several cell types, including hepatocytes116 and neutrophils117. Knocking out ATG7 in HSCs leads to an accumulation of immature neutrophils resembling the myeloid bias of an aging hematopoietic system. Differentiation can be rescued by supplementation with exogenous free fatty acids used for \u03b2-oxidation, further demonstrat- ing that lipophagy usually provides these during the energy-inten- sive process of differentiation. Further studies on the molecular mechanisms of lipophagy, including identification of lipid-specific autophagy receptors and their impact on cellular homeostasis, will shed light on the relationship among autophagy, metabolism and aging. Autophagic degradation of nucleic acids: RNAutophagy and DNAutophagy. Nucleic acids are degraded via multiple mecha- nisms (a complete description of which is beyond the scope of this Review; see details in refs. 118,119), including by autophagy.", "RNA and DNA are targeted for lysosomal degradation via several pathways, including LC3-dependent autophagic degradation of stress granules (condensates of protein and RNA)120, p62- and NDP52-dependent autophagic degradation of retrotransposon RNA121, lysosomal membrane protein LAMP2C-dependent direct binding to RNA (also DNA122) for lysosomal degradation123 and a lysosomal puta- tive RNA/DNA transporter, SID1 transmembrane family, member 2 (SIDT2), that mediates direct uptake of RNA (and DNA124) for lyso- somal degradation125. At present, little is known about whether or how RNAutophagy (also known as RNAphagy) and DNAutophagy (also known as DNAphagy) affect health and aging. However, it is reasonable to suggest that nucleic acid turnover is essential for health, as accumulation of damaged or unnecessary DNA and RNA in the cytosol promotes inflammation, cancer and even acceler- ated aging68,126,127. DNA damage triggers autophagy and subtypes of autophagy that are considered to be cell survival responses128; in contrast, genetic or age-dependent impairment of DNA repair leads to genomic instability, cellular dysfunction, cell death and acceler- ated aging68. Exogenous DNA or RNA (for example, microbial) or endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm may trigger autophagy. Nuclear DNA (including extranuclear chroma- tin) could be aberrantly released into the cytoplasm as a result of impaired nuclear envelope integrity, nuclear envelope blebbing or nuclear export processes129, while mitochondrial DNA could leak into the cytoplasm as a result of mitochondrial damage and inef- ficient elimination of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy126,127. The cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAS)\u2013stimulator of interferon genes (STING), or RIG-I\u2013MAVS, signaling axis detects these nucleic acid fragments to initiate an innate immune reaction, linking it to auto- immunity, inflammation, senescence and autophagy129.", "Collectively, genomic instability, accumulation of mitochondrial DNA leakage in the cytoplasm and increased levels of cellular stress granules are linked to inflammation, accelerated aging and a broad range of neu- rodegenerative diseases120,121,126. Although maintenance of DNA and RNA homeostasis is critical for healthy aging, the contribution of RNAutophagy and DNAutophagy to long-term tissue health and pathology requires further exploration. Autophagy of subcellular organelles: mitophagy, ER-phagy, nucleophagy and lysophagy. Aging is associated with an accu- mulation of damage to subcellular organelles. Timely and efficient disposal and recycling of dysfunctional organelles is necessary to maintain cellular function and viability. Selective autophagy is the common mechanism underlying the clearance of damaged and/or superfluous subcellular organelles such as mitochondria (mitoph- agy), the ER (reticulophagy or ER-phagy), the nucleus (nucle- ophagy) and lysosomes (lysophagy)17. Both membrane-bound and soluble selective autophagy receptors are involved in the selective degradation of organelles18,130. Among the different types of autophagy targeting subcellular organelles, the most investigated is mitophagy. Mitophagy is the selective autophagic elimination of defective or surplus mitochon- dria. The PINK1- and parkin-mediated pathway for degradation of heavily depolarized mitochondria is best understood and involves attraction by Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin of the soluble selec- tive autophagy receptors NDP52, optineurin and p62, which then recruit the core autophagy machinery for autophagosome forma- tion on the damaged mitochondria131. Other basal, developmental and stress-induced mitophagy pathways involve binding of LC3 to a series of LIR-containing mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, such as NIX (BNIP3L), BNIP3, FKBP8, FUNDC1, BCL2L13, PHB2 and AMBRA1, as well as LC3-binding mitochondrial lipids such as cardiolipin37 (Fig. 1a, pathway (6), left).", "While whole mitochondria can be degraded via mitophagy, it appears that organelles with minor damage can be \u2018repaired\u2019 by other quality-control mechanisms such as the piecemeal mitophagy pathway, which is a basal housekeep- ing mitophagy pathway that involves degradation of mitochondrial proteins in an LC3C- and p62-dependent manner132 (Fig. 1a, path- way (6), right). Other mitochondrial degradation pathways include the mitochondria-derived vesicle (MDV) pathway, where damaged cargo (for example, impaired mitochondrial proteins) is delivered to the lysosome for degradation in a process dependent on syn- taxin-17, PINK1 and parkin133. A recent study in C. elegans showed that damaged subcellular components, including mitochondria, can be budded off from certain neurons via membrane-bound ves- icles (termed \u2018exophers\u2019)134. Once in the extracellular space, these damaged organelles can be engulfed and digested by surrounding cells134. This cellular release of exophers is conserved in mammals, as cardiomyocytes release exophers (containing mitochondria) to be received and eliminated by adjacent macrophages135. Accumulating evidence has highlighted that mitophagy is a criti- cal contributor to cellular physiology and organ homeostasis. First, there is an increase in mitophagy from juvenile stages to adulthood, followed by a dramatic reduction in aged animals. For example, there is an increase in basal mitophagy levels in fly flight muscles from the ages of 1 week to 4 weeks136; in mice, mitophagy in the den- tate gyrus (DG), a region of the brain that is essential for memory, was reduced by approximately 70% between the ages of 3 and 21 months137. Mitophagy is also impaired under high-fat feeding con- ditions137 and in neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed in ref. 37).", "Indeed, mitophagy is reduced in mice with AD (by approximately 50% in the hippocampus in comparison to healthy controls)138, NATuRE AGING | VOL 1 | AUGUST 2021 | 634\u2013650 | www.nature.com/nataging 641 Review ARticle NATURe AgINg Parkinson\u2019s disease (reviewed in ref. 139) and Huntington\u2019s disease (by over 70% in the DG of huntingtin-expressing mice versus wild- type controls)137. Second, intact mitophagic machinery is required for longevity. Because there are several redundant mitophagy path- ways, dysfunction of isolated individual mitophagy pathways may not affect lifespan140,141. However, mitophagy is essential for longev- ity under conditions of low insulin/IGF-1 signaling (C. elegans daf-2 mutants) and dietary restriction (C. elegans eat-2 mutants)140,142, as well as for the maintenance of neuronal functions in response to stressful conditions126. Third, mitophagy induction is sufficient to improve healthspan and extends lifespan in several model organ- isms, rescues age-associated neurodegenerative phenotypes in AD138,143 and prolongs lifespan in nematode and fly models of accel- erated aging66,111,144. Moreover, functional mitophagy is essential for restraining innate immunity, as mitochondrial stress can lead to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immunity. Inflammation resulting from exces- sive exercise in Pink1- and Parkin-knockout mice has been shown to be suppressed by loss of STING, a central regulator of the type I interferon response to cytosolic DNA126. Other autophagic pathways that target subcellular organelles include ER-phagy, nucleophagy and lysophagy. In yeast, Atg39 reg- ulates perinuclear ER-phagy and nucleophagy, while Atg40 is nec- essary for cortical and cytoplasmic ER-phagy145 (Fig. 1a, pathway (7)). ER-phagy is conserved in mammalian cells through specific ER-phagy receptors, such as FAM134B, SEC62, RTN3L, CCPG1, ATL3 and TEX264 (reviewed in ref. 146).", "Nucleophagy is conserved in mammalian cells147 and involves nuclear LC3B\u2013lamin B1 inter- action-based nuclear-to-cytoplasmic degradation, which may be a defense mechanism protecting cells from tumorigenesis148 (Fig. 1a, pathway (8)). Lysophagy is regulated by both ubiquitin-dependent (galectin-3\u2013TRIM16\u2013ULK1\u2013autophagy receptor\u2013LC3, the F-box protein FBXO27 and UBE2QL1) and ubiquitin-independent (galec- tin-8\u2013autophagy receptor\u2013LC3) pathways (reviewed in ref. 149) (Fig. 1a, pathway (11)). Maintenance of functional and effective lyso- somes, via timely and efficient lysophagy, is essential for cell survival. In particular, dysfunction in lysosomal membrane proteins such as SCAV-3, the C. elegans homolog of human LIMP-2, has been linked to reduced lifespan, implicating lysosome integrity as a defining factor in longevity150,151,25. Moreover, dysfunctional lysosomal membrane pro- teins coupled to leakage of proteolytic enzymes (that is, cathepsin D) into the cytosol have been associated with aging and pathological aging in a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases152. Thus, main- taining physiological lysophagy is critical for many cellular processes and is presumably important for health and longevity, as lysosomal rupture triggers endolysosomal damage responses and even lysosomal cell death, which is linked to aging and diseases152,153. Collectively, an imbalanced quality surveillance system for subcel- lular organelles, such as mitochondria, the ER, small nuclear fractions and lysosomes, might be a causative factor for age-related pathologies as well as premature aging. Further studies on mitophagy, ER-phagy, nucleophagy and lysophagy to decipher their multilayer regulatory network and association with aging and health are necessary. In par- ticular, studies to address how these processes change with age and how they influence age-related tissue function will lead to critical insights with broad relevance to human health and quality of life. Xenophagy.", "Xenophagy (from the Greek meaning \u2018to eat foreign matter\u2019) is the process by which autophagy targets pathogens154. Many pathogens are known to be degraded by autophagy, while others take over core autophagy components for their own ben- efit155 (Fig. 1a, pathway (9)). Indeed, several studies have dem- onstrated that autophagy can target bacteria such as Rickettsia conorii156, Listeria monocytogenes157, Streptococcus pyogenes158 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis159,160. Xenophagy may also protect the body against invasion by viruses and parasites. Upon their intake by inhalation, M. tuberculosis bacteria are cap- tured by alveolar macrophages. However, they have evolved the abil- ity to impair phagosome maturation (which under normal conditions would lead to phagocytosis) and end up hijacking macrophages161. Later on, using secretions from ESX-1 (6-kDa early secretory anti- genic target (ESAT-6) secretion system 1), the bacteria are able to break free from the phagosome and enter the cytosol. Here xenoph- agy comes into action. cGAS detects the bacterial DNA162, which results in ubiquitination of the invading bacteria by Smurf1 (or par- kin)163. NBR1 (or p62) attaches to these ubiquitin chains, resulting in the recruitment of LC3B and, ultimately, autophagic degradation164. Indeed, an absence of autophagic machinery components, in par- ticular, ULK1 (ref. 165), BECN1 (ref. 166), p62 (ref. 167), ATG7 (ref. 168) and TBK1 (ref. 167), may promote proliferation of the bacteria. The mechanism is similar for specific viruses. BECN1 and p62 in selec- tive autophagy of viral capsids can be protective against Sindbis virus169,170. However, other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 1, have evolved to inhibit autophagy by targeting BECN1 (ref. 171).", "In addition, several studies have highlighted the importance and pos- sible therapeutic relevance of autophagy for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)172\u2013174. With respect to parasites, autophagy can control Toxoplasma gondii, while knockout of ATG5, ATG7 or ATG16L1 renders mice more likely to succumb to parasites175. A detailed review of the relationship between para- sites and autophagy is available176. Although there are not many data available on a direct link between xenophagy and aging or lifespan, it is conceivable that blocking infection by exogenous intruders is required for mainte- nance of a healthy state and reduced inflammation151,177. Further work to investigate the molecular mechanisms of xenophagy and their association with aging and longevity is required. Tissue-specific autophagy in aging. As aging is associated with functional decline at both the tissue and organismal level, it is important to understand how aging within individual tissues affects, and is affected by, aging across the entire organism. Evidence from nematodes, flies and mice has revealed that autophagy may have tissue-specific roles in regulating aging14. Inhibition of lgg-1 and atg-18 specifically in the body wall muscle of adult worms is suf- ficient to shorten the lifespan of the long-lived dietary-restricted eat-2 and insulin/IGF-1 receptor-deficient daf-2 mutants28,178. In addition, the shortened lifespan in atg-18 mutants (ATG-18 is a member of the WIPI protein family, homologous to mammalian WIPI-1 and WIPI-2) can be suppressed by tissue-specific restora- tion of ATG-18 function: pan-neuronal or intestine-specific expres- sion of atg-18 fully restored the lifespan of atg-18 mutants to that of wild-type worms, while muscle- or hypodermis-specific rescue of ATG-18 had little to no ability to restore lifespan179.", "In flies, promo- tion of autophagy in muscle tissue via overexpression of Atg8a or the transcription factor FOXO was sufficient to extend lifespan78,180, while, in mice, inhibition of autophagy through muscle-specific ATG7 deficiency resulted in impaired muscle function (possibly via mitochondrial dysfunction) and decreased lifespan181. Furthermore, enhancing autophagy specifically in the intestine results in main- tenance of intestinal barrier function and promotes longevity and healthspan in worms and flies45,178. Given that tissues age unevenly, with some tissues presenting with faster degeneration than others182, it will be interesting to determine how closely rates of aging and autophagy are correlated in different tissues throughout life. Defective autophagy in diseases associated with accelerated aging, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammaging Accumulating evidence from studies using laboratory animals and human samples supports an essential role for autophagy in NATuRE AGING | VOL 1 | AUGUST 2021 | 634\u2013650 | www.nature.com/nataging 642 Review ARticle NATURe AgINg embryonic development, tissue health and lifespan through the suppression of age-associated inflammation (inflammaging), main- tenance of genomic integrity, preservation of cellular and tissue homeostasis, and rejuvenation of stem cells (Fig. 3a; refs. 13,14,68,69). While autophagy is tightly regulated by multiple molecular path- ways involving central modulators of energy metabolism, such as AMPK, mTORC1, sirtuins and calcineurin (Fig. 3b), several inter- ventions such as dietary restriction, exercise and supplementation with small chemical compounds (detailed below) stimulate autoph- agy69.", "Recent preclinical studies have linked impairment of general autophagy or subtypes of autophagy (in some diseases, while a sub- type of selective autophagy is impaired, there may be no change, or even an increase, in general autophagy) to pathological states such as progeria and a series of accelerated aging diseases68 (Fig. 3c), neurodegenerative diseases19,37 (Fig. 3d) and other disorders13,14,68,69. For example, maintenance of CMA in aged cells sustains HSC function183 and prevents collapse of the neuronal metastable pro- teome184. Similarly, mitophagy, which is reduced in both normal aging and AD, extends healthspan140 and suppresses amyloid \u03b2- and phosphorylated tau-induced memory loss when stimulated in aged tissues138. Understanding the relationship between compromised autoph- agy and other hallmarks of aging will provide a better understand- ing of the molecular events that promote aging and disease14,68,69.

These premature aging diseases are ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Cockayne syndrome (CS), Fanconi anemia (FA), Hutchinson\u2013Gilford syndrome (HG), Werner syndrome (WS) and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP; especially group A). Changes in autophagy and mitophagy in Hutchinson\u2013Gilford syndrome are elusive. d, Autophagy (including subtypes of selective autophagy, such as mitophagy) is impaired in broad neurodegenerative diseases, where impairment may drive or exacerbate disease progression. These diseases include AD, Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Huntington\u2019s disease, ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We emphasize that these are not the only drivers of the diseases and other processes may have roles leading to pathology and symptomatology. NATuRE AGING | VOL 1 | AUGUST 2021 | 634\u2013650 | www.nature.com/nataging 643 Review ARticle NATURe AgINg Among the many age-related changes previously described, inflam- mation is linked to autophagy, as impaired autophagy results in inflammation, and has emerged as a major driver of age-related tis- sue damage63,69,185,186. Inflammation is an evolutionarily conserved protective mechanism designed to maintain organismal homeostasis in the face of acute and local perturbations and serves as an adaptive response to infection or injury187. Chronic, systemic inflammation develops progressively with age and contributes to organismal dete- rioration through the process termed inflammaging186. Autophagy has been identified as one of the pivotal mechanisms orchestrating the differentiation and metabolic state of innate immune cells.", "In particular, the balance between mTOR and AMPK activa- tion has a central role in immune cell maintenance and function. Upon mTOR activation, autophagic flux is reduced, accompanied by increased cellular glycolytic activity, giving rise to a proliferative and pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages. In contrast, AMPK activation drives autophagy and promotes the OXPHOS-dependent function of non- or anti-inflammatory macrophages188. Autophagy also regulates the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain- containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is an intra- cellular protein complex that activates caspase-1, which in turn catalyzes the cleavage, activation and subsequent release of pro- inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2), which can induce neurodegeneration186,189. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been identified as a critical component of the innate immune response (that is, the response to microbial motifs, endogenous danger signals and environmental irritants) and orchestrates host immune homeostasis189. Defective autophagy, for example, in mod- els of selective knockout or knockdown of genes encoding compo- nents of the autophagic core machinery (for example, ATG5, ATG7, BECN1 and MAP1LC3B), results in unrestricted inflammasome activation and consequent inflammation. Likewise, promotion of autophagy through starvation or with pharmacological agents (for example, rapamycin) inhibits the inflammasome190. In addition, evidence stemming from an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD dem- onstrated mitophagy-induced inhibition of the NLRP3 inflamma- some, resulting in reduced neuroinflammation138. These findings imply an important role for autophagy in the regulation of inflam- mation and, in turn, aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Anti-aging effects of autophagy modulators The mounting evidence that an imbalance of autophagy is an impor- tant age-associated characteristic has driven extensive research into the development of compounds that can promote autophagy1.", "Pharmacological agents promoting autophagy can be classified on the basis of their effect on the mTOR pathway191. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin has been shown to reduce protein synthesis and pro- mote autophagy, both of which contribute to extended lifespan in yeast, nematodes, flies and mice (Table 2). In addition, rapamycin has been demonstrated to protect against neurodegenerative dis- eases, including AD, via promotion of autophagy; however, rapamy- cin treatment was observed to be detrimental in the case of models of ALS, possibly owing to non-autophagy-related side effects191. Other pharmacological agents reported to promote autophagy via direct interaction with mTOR include torin-1 and PP242 (ref. 192). mTOR-independent promoters of autophagy mainly act via the AMPK pathway. Examples include metformin and trehalose, which have been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing autophagy, extending lifespan and protecting against neurodegeneration in experimental models191. Compounds such as resveratrol and spermidine modulate the acetylation state of proteins to regulate autophagy and promote lon- gevity. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that reportedly promotes lifespan in C. elegans and healthspan in mice via activation of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 (refs. 112,193,194). Spermidine is a polyamine that extends the lifespan of yeast, worms, flies and mice by enhancing autophagy through inhibition of the EP300 acetyltransferase195, among other mechanisms55,196\u2013198. The longev- ity-extending effects of spermidine are abolished upon depletion or deletion of essential autophagy genes such as bec-1 in C. elegans and Atg7 in yeast and flies197,199. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibi- tion of XPO-1 results in enhanced autophagy (as evidenced by an increase in the frequency of autophagosomes and autolysosomes) and increased lifespan in C. elegans. These effects were mediated by nuclear enrichment of HLH-30, which occurred in an mTOR- independent manner47.", "Additional modulators of TFEB homologs that regulate autophagy and have also been demonstrated to pro- tect against pathophysiological aging include ouabain and fisetin. Ouabain is a cardiac glycoside that enhances activation of TFEB through inhibition of the mTOR pathway and induces downstream autophagy\u2013lysosomal gene expression and cellular restorative prop- erties200. Ouabain has been shown to reduce the accumulation of abnormal toxic tau both in vitro and in vivo200. Fisetin is a flavo- nol and was shown to facilitate the clearance of endogenous tau via TFEB (through inhibition of mTOR kinases) and Nrf2 activation20. Other small molecules that induce subtypes of autophagy, espe- cially mitophagy, also enhance longevity and suppress age-associ- ated diseases. These include NAD+, a fundamental metabolite in energy metabolism, redox homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and the arbitration of cell survival and death185. NAD+-activated sir- tuins stimulate autophagy via mTOR inhibition and deacetylation of several key autophagy proteins (ATG5, ATG7 and ATG8)201,202. In addition, the NAD+\u2013SIRT axis activates mitophagy by increas- ing the activity of a series of mitophagy-related proteins, such as PINK1, parkin, NIX (DCT-1 in C. elegans) and BNIP3 (refs. 66,203). Supplementation with NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucle- otide (NMN), can increase lifespan and/or improve healthspan in worms, flies and mice111,204\u2013206. NAD+ augmentation also prevents memory loss in both amyloid \u03b2 and tau C. elegans and mouse mod- els of AD, in a mitophagy-dependent manner (requiring pink-1, pdr-1 or dct-1)138. Over seven human clinical trials have shown the safety and bioavailability of NR (1\u20132 g per day for up to 3 months); there are more than 30 ongoing clinical trials on the use of NR to treat premature aging and other age-related diseases (see a review in ref. 185).", "Another clinically promising mitophagy inducer is uro- lithin A, a metabolite of ellagitannins from the gut microflora. Urolithin A extends healthspan and lifespan in C. elegans, with lifespan extension depending on genes involved in autophagy (that is, bec-1, sqst-1 and vps-34) and mitophagy (pink-1, dct-1 and the nonspecific skn-1)207. Intriguingly, urolithin A inhibits memory loss in both amyloid \u03b2 and tau C. elegans and mouse models of AD in a mitophagy-dependent manner (dependent on pink-1, pdr-1 or dct-1)138. Urolithin A (500 mg and 1,000 mg per day for 4 weeks) was also shown to be safe in a phase 1 clinical trial208. A summary of different lifespan/health-benefit mitophagy inducers can be found in Table 2. Encouraged by the clinical safety of NR and urolithin A, their effects on healthspan and lifespan in older individuals deserve further investigation. Despite recent progress in the identification of novel as well as well-known autophagy-inducing compounds, it is also of great importance to highlight the pleiotropic effects of these pharmacological interventions and to completely understand the full complement of targets with which they interact to use them safely for therapeutic intervention. While experimental/empirical evidence indicates that autoph- agy is defective in older individuals, it is conceivable that exposing individuals to autophagy inducers, dietary restriction and exercise late in life could boost autophagy and result in benefits to tissue function209,210 (Fig. 4a). On the basis of preclinical data, it is pre- sumed that autophagy stimulation (ideally to increase autophagy to the levels observed early in adulthood) may be sufficient to provide benefits (Fig. 4b).", "NATuRE AGING | VOL 1 | AUGUST 2021 | 634\u2013650 | www.nature.com/nataging 644 Review ARticle NATURe AgINg Conclusions and future perspectives Mounting evidence from studies using laboratory animals, human tissues and related clinical trials supports the concept that (1) there is an age-dependent decline in autophagy, (2) autophagy is a cru- cial determinant of cellular health and organismal longevity and (3) impairment or imbalance in autophagy promotes pathological aging and disease. Given the broad spectrum of unique properties associ- ated with autophagy, we propose that \u2018compromised autophagy\u2019 is a central feature of normal aging. Although the relationship between autophagy and aging is often described as \u2018decreased autophagy is detrimental\u2019 and \u2018increased autophagy is beneficial\u2019, this may be too simplistic a picture. Instead, long-term health benefits will likely arise from achieving the right balance of autophagy, which itself will depend on tissue and organismal age. For example, in C. elegans, impairing autophagy early in life has a negative effect on longevity, whereas knockdown of a specific subset of autophagy genes in adult- hood may have beneficial effects on lifespan59. Similarly, increased autophagy through a hypermorphic allele of atg-5 has differential effects on polyglutamine aggregation in the muscles and neurons of C. elegans211. In flies, a mild increase in autophagy extends lifes- pan, whereas strongly increasing autophagy shortens lifespan212. It should also be noted that autophagy induction may also result in unwanted effects, such as multiple senescence pathologies59 and resistance to cancer therapy (reviewed in ref. 213). Collectively, these observations suggest that the level of and balance among the differ- ent forms of autophagy in each tissue are highly specified for each stage of life, and an understanding of this will be crucial for healthy aging.", "Thus, while different types of autophagy may influence aging to different extents, a central goal for promoting health will be to find approaches that can fine-tune autophagy to the right levels, at the right time and in the right tissues, to enhance health (Fig. 4). To achieve this, it will be critical to develop novel interventions that allow for controlled delivery of autophagy modulators into specific tissues or cell types at precise stages of life. Such therapeutic strate- gies could then be administered chronically, acutely or in a pulsed fashion as and when required. Additionally, it may be necessary to specifically induce either general or selective autophagy to provide overall long-term health benefits66. For example, premature aging diseases such as ataxia telangiectasia, xeroderma pigmentosum group A and Cockayne syndrome exhibit increased general autoph- agy but impaired mitophagy; therefore, specifically stimulating mitophagy, rather than general autophagy, would be the most effi- cient way to counteract pathological features while avoiding detri- mental side effects66. There are many outstanding questions related to autophagy in aging that need to be addressed. For example, what are the intri- cate mechanisms that orchestrate distinct autophagic pathways? How is autophagy spatially and temporally regulated, and how does disruption of this regulation suppress or promote disease? Are some aspects of autophagy more important in an age- and/or tissue-dependent manner? What are the determining factors that dictate the route of degradation, via the UPS or autophagy? How are clearance mechanisms balanced with synthesis and folding through the proteostasis network? What are the thresholds of life-beneficial and life-detrimental autophagy?", "In line with the traditional Chinese yin\u2013yang philosophy, autophagy must be balanced, as diminished autophagy results in the accumulation of toxic subcellular compo- nents while excessive autophagy can lead to organ atrophy and other detrimental effects14,37,59,69,212. Furthermore, compensatory responses between proteolytic systems (for example, between autophagy and the UPS214) have a critical role in determining the onset and rate of age-related tissue deterioration and should be considered in future experimental designs and data interpretation. Finally, are there any conditions or diseases where we should be cautious about inducing autophagy, in that protection against one form of pathology may increase the risk for another? For example, pancreatic cancer cells may hijack autophagy processes to obtain nutrients for growth; hence, in this condition, autophagy inhibition in combination with cancer chemotherapies may inhibit pancreatic cancer growth215,216. Addressing these questions will facilitate understanding of the aging process and, more importantly, enable identification of novel tar- gets that may be manipulated for therapeutic intervention in age- associated diseases.
